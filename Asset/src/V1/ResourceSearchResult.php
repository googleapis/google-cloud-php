     *     @type string $state

     *           types. This field is available only when the resource's Protobuf contains
     *           it.
     *           Example:
     *           If the resource is an instance provided by Compute Engine,
     *           its state will include PROVISIONING, STAGING, RUNNING, STOPPING,
     *           SUSPENDING, SUSPENDED, REPAIRING, and TERMINATED. See `status` definition
     *           in [API
     *           Reference](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances).
     *           If the resource is a project provided by Cloud Resource Manager, its state
     *           will include LIFECYCLE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED, ACTIVE, DELETE_REQUESTED and
     *           DELETE_IN_PROGRESS. See `lifecycleState` definition in [API
     *           Reference](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects).
     *           To search against the `state`:
     *           * Use a field query. Example: `state:RUNNING`
     *           * Use a free text query. Example: `RUNNING`
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Struct $additional_attributes
     *           The additional searchable attributes of this resource. The attributes may
     *           vary from one resource type to another. Examples: `projectId` for Project,
     *           `dnsName` for DNS ManagedZone. This field contains a subset of the resource
     *           metadata fields that are returned by the List or Get APIs provided by the
     *           corresponding GCP service (e.g., Compute Engine). see [API references and
     *           supported searchable
     *           attributes](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types)
     *           to see which fields are included.
     *           You can search values of these fields through free text search. However,
     *           you should not consume the field programically as the field names and
     *           values may change as the GCP service updates to a new incompatible API
     *           version.
     *           To search against the `additional_attributes`:
     *           * Use a free text query to match the attributes values. Example: to search
     *             `additional_attributes = { dnsName: "foobar" }`, you can issue a query
     *             `foobar`.
     *     @type string $parent_full_resource_name
     *           The full resource name of this resource's parent, if it has one.
     *           To search against the `parent_full_resource_name`:
     *           * Use a field query. Example:
     *           `parentFullResourceName:"project-name"`
     *           * Use a free text query. Example:
     *           `project-name`
     *     @type array<\Google\Cloud\Asset\V1\VersionedResource>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $versioned_resources
     *           Versioned resource representations of this resource. This is repeated
     *           because there could be multiple versions of resource representations during
     *           version migration.
     *           This `versioned_resources` field is not searchable. Some attributes of the
     *           resource representations are exposed in `additional_attributes` field, so
     *           as to allow users to search on them.
     *     @type array<\Google\Cloud\Asset\V1\AttachedResource>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $attached_resources
     *           Attached resources of this resource. For example, an OSConfig
     *           Inventory is an attached resource of a Compute Instance. This field is
     *           repeated because a resource could have multiple attached resources.
     *           This `attached_resources` field is not searchable. Some attributes
     *           of the attached resources are exposed in `additional_attributes` field, so
     *           as to allow users to search on them.
     *     @type array|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\MapField $relationships
     *           A map of related resources of this resource, keyed by the
     *           relationship type. A relationship type is in the format of
     *           {SourceType}_{ACTION}_{DestType}. Example: `DISK_TO_INSTANCE`,
     *           `DISK_TO_NETWORK`, `INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP`.
     *           See [supported relationship
     *           types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#supported_relationship_types).
     *     @type array<string>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $tag_keys
     *           TagKey namespaced names, in the format of {ORG_ID}/{TAG_KEY_SHORT_NAME}.
     *           To search against the `tagKeys`:
     *           * Use a field query. Example:
     *               - `tagKeys:"123456789/env*"`
     *               - `tagKeys="123456789/env"`
     *               - `tagKeys:"env"`
     *           * Use a free text query. Example:
     *               - `env`
     *     @type array<string>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $tag_values
     *           TagValue namespaced names, in the format of
     *           {ORG_ID}/{TAG_KEY_SHORT_NAME}/{TAG_VALUE_SHORT_NAME}.
     *           To search against the `tagValues`:
     *           * Use a field query. Example:

     *               - `tagValues:"env/prod"`
     *               - `tagValues:"123456789/env/prod*"`
     *               - `tagValues="123456789/env/prod"`
