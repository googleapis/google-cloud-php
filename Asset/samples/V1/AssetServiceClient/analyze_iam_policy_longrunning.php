 * [AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse][google.cloud.asset.v1.AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse]. This method implements the
 * [google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation], which allows you to track the operation
 * status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential
 * backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the
