/**
 * Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
 * location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the
 * output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a
 * [google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset][google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset] in the JSON format; for BigQuery table
 * destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as
 * columns. This API implements the [google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] API,
 * which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at
 * least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result.
 * For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes
 * within 5 minutes.
 *
 * @param string $parent The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an

 *                       "projects/my-project-id"), or a project number (such as "projects/12345"),
 *                       or a folder number (such as "folders/123").
