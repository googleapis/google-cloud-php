/**
 * Creates a saved query in a parent project/folder/organization.
 *
 * @param string $formattedParent The name of the project/folder/organization where this saved_query
 *                                should be created in. It can only be an organization number (such as
 *                                "organizations/123"), a folder number (such as "folders/123"), a project ID
 *                                (such as "projects/my-project-id")", or a project number (such as
 *                                "projects/12345"). Please see
 *                                {@see AssetServiceClient::projectName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $savedQueryId    The ID to use for the saved query, which must be unique in the specified
 *                                parent. It will become the final component of the saved query's resource
 *                                name.
 *
 *                                This value should be 4-63 characters, and valid characters
 *                                are /[a-z][0-9]-/.
 *
 *                                Notice that this field is required in the saved query creation, and the
 *                                `name` field of the `saved_query` will be ignored.
