Now to install just run:

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

stable and we're working towards a release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.
