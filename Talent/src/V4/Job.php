     *           in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an
     *           exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to
     *           [PostingRegion.NATION][google.cloud.talent.v4.PostingRegion.NATION] or [PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA][google.cloud.talent.v4.PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA],
     *           setting job [Job.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.addresses] to the same location level as this field

     *     @type int $visibility
     *           Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner.
     *           The visibility of the job.
     *           Defaults to [Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY][google.cloud.talent.v4.Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY] if not specified.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $job_start_time
     *           The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field
     *           is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $job_end_time
     *           The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting
     *           engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_publish_time
     *           The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default
     *           value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are
     *           ignored.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_expire_time
     *           Strongly recommended for the best service experience.
     *           The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the
     *           job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The
     *           expired job can't be listed by the [ListJobs][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.ListJobs] API,
     *           but it can be retrieved with the [GetJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.GetJob] API or
     *           updated with the [UpdateJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.UpdateJob] API or deleted with
     *           the [DeleteJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.DeleteJob] API. An expired job can
     *           be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp.
     *           Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with
     *           same [company][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.company], [language_code][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.language_code] and [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.requisition_id].
     *           The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the
     *           overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of
     *           open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded,
     *           expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time.
     *           Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned
     *           out.
     *           Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.
     *           If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job
     *           is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can
     *           not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the
     *           [posting_publish_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_publish_time] must be set before
     *           [posting_expire_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_expire_time]. The purpose of this feature is
     *           to allow other objects, such as [Application][], to refer a job
     *           that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you
     *           want to modify a job that was expired on creation,
     *           delete it and create a new one.
     *           If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,
     *           the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For
     *           example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an
     *           unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.
     *           If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks
     *           set by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include
     *           [job_end_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.job_end_time], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is
     *           updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last
     *           update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_create_time
     *           Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_update_time
