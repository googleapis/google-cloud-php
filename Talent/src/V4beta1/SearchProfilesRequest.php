     *     @type string $result_set_id
     *           Optional. An id that uniquely identifies the result set of a
     *           [SearchProfiles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.ProfileService.SearchProfiles]
     *           call. The id should be retrieved from the
     *           [SearchProfilesResponse][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesResponse]
     *           message returned from a previous invocation of
     *           [SearchProfiles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.ProfileService.SearchProfiles].
     *           A result set is an ordered list of search results.
     *           If this field is not set, a new result set is computed based on the
     *           [profile_query][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.profile_query].
     *           A new
     *           [result_set_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.result_set_id]
     *           is returned as a handle to access this result set.
     *           If this field is set, the service will ignore the resource and
     *           [profile_query][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.profile_query]
     *           values, and simply retrieve a page of results from the corresponding result
     *           set.  In this case, one and only one of
     *           [page_token][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.page_token]
     *           or [offset][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.offset] must
     *           be set.
     *           A typical use case is to invoke
     *           [SearchProfilesRequest][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest]
     *           without this field, then use the resulting
     *           [result_set_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesRequest.result_set_id]
     *           in
     *           [SearchProfilesResponse][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesResponse]
     *           to page through the results.
     *     @type bool $strict_keywords_search
     *           Optional. This flag is used to indicate whether the service will attempt to
     *           understand synonyms and terms related to the search query or treat the
     *           query "as is" when it generates a set of results. By default this flag is
     *           set to false, thus allowing expanded results to also be returned. For
     *           example a search for "software engineer" might also return candidates who
     *           have experience in jobs similar to software engineer positions. By setting
     *           this flag to true, the service will only attempt to deliver candidates has
     *           software engineer in his/her global fields by treating "software engineer"
     *           as a keyword.
     *           It is recommended to provide a feature in the UI (such as a checkbox) to
     *           allow recruiters to set this flag to true if they intend to search for
     *           longer boolean strings.
