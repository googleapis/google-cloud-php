     * 1. All of the profile's geocoded [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses] where

     * CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current] is not set.
     * This means that any profiles without any [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses] that match

     * WORK or SCHOOL or where [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current] is false are not considered for

     * [LocationType][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType], center

     * [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles].
     * If [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address] is provided,
