/**
 * Configuration of the barge-in behavior. Barge-in instructs the API to return
 * a detected utterance at a proper time while the client is playing back the
 * response audio from a previous request. When the client sees the
 * utterance, it should stop the playback and immediately get ready for
 * receiving the responses for the current request.
 * The barge-in handling requires the client to start streaming audio input
 * as soon as it starts playing back the audio from the previous response. The
 * playback is modeled into two phases:
 * * No barge-in phase: which goes first and during which speech detection
 *   should not be carried out.
 * * Barge-in phase: which follows the no barge-in phase and during which
 *   the API starts speech detection and may inform the client that an utterance
 *   has been detected. Note that no-speech event is not expected in this
 *   phase.
 * The client provides this configuration in terms of the durations of those
 * two phases. The durations are measured in terms of the audio length from the
 * start of the input audio.
 * No-speech event is a response with END_OF_UTTERANCE without any transcript
 * following up.
