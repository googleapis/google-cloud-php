## CI Status

PHP Version  | Status
------------ | ------
PHP 7.4 | [![Kokoro CI](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-devrel-public/php/badges/google-cloud-php/php74.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-devrel-public/php/badges/google-cloud-php/php74.html)

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/google/cloud/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/google/cloud) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dm/google/cloud.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/google/cloud)

View the [list of supported APIs and Services](https://cloud.google.com/php/docs/reference).

If you need support for other Google APIs, please check out the [Google APIs Client Library for PHP](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client).

## Quick Start

We recommend installing individual component packages. A list of available packages can be found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/search/?q=google%2Fcloud-).

For example:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-storage
$ composer require google/cloud-bigquery
$ composer require google/cloud-datastore
```

You can then include the autoloader and create your client:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient;

$storage = new StorageClient();

$bucket = $storage->bucket('my_bucket');

// Upload a file to the bucket.
$bucket->upload(
    fopen('/data/file.txt', 'r')
);

// Download and store an object from the bucket locally.
$object = $bucket->object('file_backup.txt');
$object->downloadToFile('/data/file_backup.txt');
```

### Authentication

Authentication is handled by the client library automatically. You just need to provide the authentication details when creating a client. Generally, authentication is accomplished using a Service Account. For more information on obtaining Service Account credentials, see our [Authentication Guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#manually).

Once you've obtained your credentials file, it may be used to create an authenticated client.

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient;

// Authenticate using a keyfile path
$cloud = new StorageClient([
    'keyFilePath' => 'path/to/keyfile.json'
]);

// Authenticate using keyfile data
$cloud = new StorageClient([
    'keyFile' => json_decode(file_get_contents('/path/to/keyfile.json'), true)
]);
```

If you do not wish to embed your authentication information in your application code, you may also make use of [Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials).

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient;

putenv('GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/keyfile.json');

$cloud = new StorageClient();
```

The `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable may be set in your server configuration.

### gRPC and Protobuf

Many clients in Google Cloud PHP offer support for gRPC, either as an option or a requirement. gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework created by Google. To use gRPC in PHP, you must install the gRPC PHP extension on your server. While not required, it is also recommended that you install the protobuf extension whenever using gRPC in production.

```
$ pecl install grpc
$ pecl install protobuf
```

## Caching Access Tokens

By default the library will use a simple in-memory caching implementation, however it is possible to override this behavior by passing a [PSR-6](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) caching implementation in to the desired client.

The following example takes advantage of [Symfony's Cache Component](https://github.com/symfony/cache).

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient;
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\ArrayAdapter;

// Please take the proper precautions when storing your access tokens in a cache no matter the implementation.
$cache = new ArrayAdapter();

$storage = new StorageClient([
    'authCache' => $cache
]);
```

This library provides a PSR-6 implementation with the SystemV shared memory at `Google\Auth\Cache\SysVCacheItemPool`. This implementation is only available on *nix machines, but it's the one of the fastest implementations and you can share the cache among multiple processes. The following example shows how to use it.

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Spanner\SpannerClient;
use Google\Auth\Cache\SysVCacheItemPool;

$cache = new SysVCacheItemPool();

$spanner = new SpannerClient([
    'authCache' => $cache
]);
```

## PHP Versions Supported

All client libraries support PHP 7.4 and above.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Please note it is currently under active development. Any release versioned
0.x.y is subject to backwards incompatible changes at any time.

**GA**: Libraries defined at a GA quality level are stable, and will not
introduce backwards-incompatible changes in any minor or patch releases. We will
address issues and requests with the highest priority. Please note, for any
components which include generated clients the GA guarantee will only apply to
clients which interact with stable services. For example, in a component which
hosts V1 and V1beta1 generated clients, the GA guarantee will only apply to the
V1 client as the service it interacts with is considered stable.

**Beta**: Libraries defined at a Beta quality level are expected to be mostly
stable and we're working towards their release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.

## Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.
