     *           Output only. Returns true if the Service is currently being acted upon by
     *           the system to bring it into the desired state.
     *           When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run
     *           will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Service to the
     *           desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation.
     *           While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`,
     *           `latest_ready_revision`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient
     *           values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over
     *           (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
     *           succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was an error,
     *           and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
     *           `terminal_condition.state`.
     *           If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and
     *           `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`,
     *           `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`.
     *           If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and
     *           `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision,
     *           or empty for newly created Services. Additional information on the failure
     *           can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.
