/**
 * Sends a command to the specified device. In order for a device to be able
 * to receive commands, it must:
 * 1) be connected to Cloud IoT Core using the MQTT protocol, and
 * 2) be subscribed to the group of MQTT topics specified by
 * /devices/{device-id}/commands/#. This subscription will receive commands
 * at the top-level topic /devices/{device-id}/commands as well as commands
 * for subfolders, like /devices/{device-id}/commands/subfolder.
 * Note that subscribing to specific subfolders is not supported.
 * If the command could not be delivered to the device, this method will
 * return an error; in particular, if the device is not subscribed, this
 * method will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. Otherwise, this method will
 * return OK. If the subscription is QoS 1, at least once delivery will be
 * guaranteed; for QoS 0, no acknowledgment will be expected from the device.
 *
 * @param string $formattedName The name of the device. For example,
 *                              `projects/p0/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/device0` or
 *                              `projects/p0/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/{num_id}`. Please see
 *                              {@see DeviceManagerClient::deviceName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $binaryData    The command data to send to the device.
