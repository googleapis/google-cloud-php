/**
 * If `relaxations` is empty, the start time and sequence of all visits
 * on `routes` are fully constrained and no new visits may be inserted or
 * added to those routes. Also, a vehicle's start and end time in
 * `routes` is fully constrained, unless the vehicle is empty (i.e., has no
 * visits and has `used_if_route_is_empty` set to false in the model).
 * `relaxations(i).level` specifies the constraint relaxation level applied
 * to a visit #j that satisfies:
 *   * `route.visits(j).start_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
 *   * `j + 1 >= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count`
 * Similarly, the vehicle start is relaxed to `relaxations(i).level` if it
 * satisfies:
 *   * `vehicle_start_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
 *   * `relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count == 0`
 * and the vehicle end is relaxed to `relaxations(i).level` if it satisfies:
 *   * `vehicle_end_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
 *   * `route.visits_size() + 1 >= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count`
 * To apply a relaxation level if a visit meets the `threshold_visit_count`
 * OR the `threshold_time` add two `relaxations` with the same `level`:
 * one with only `threshold_visit_count` set and the other with only
 * `threshold_time` set. If a visit satisfies the conditions of multiple
 * `relaxations`, the most relaxed level applies. As a result, from the
 * vehicle start through the route visits in order to the vehicle end, the
 * relaxation level becomes more relaxed: i.e., the relaxation level is
 * non-decreasing as the route progresses.
 * The timing and sequence of route visits that do not satisfy the
 * threshold conditions of any `relaxations` are fully constrained
 * and no visits may be inserted into these sequences. Also, if a
 * vehicle start or end does not satisfy the conditions of any
 * relaxation the time is fixed, unless the vehicle is empty.
