/**
 * One may further constrain the frequency and duration of the breaks
 * specified above, by enforcing a minimum break frequency, such as
 * "There must be a break of at least 1 hour every 12 hours". Assuming that
 * this can be interpreted as "Within any sliding time window of 12h, there
 * must be at least one break of at least one hour", that example would
 * translate to the following `FrequencyConstraint`:
 * ```
 * {
 *    min_break_duration { seconds: 3600 }         # 1 hour.
 *    max_inter_break_duration { seconds: 39600 }  # 11 hours (12 - 1 = 11).
 * }
 * ```
 * The timing and duration of the breaks in the solution will respect all
 * such constraints, in addition to the time windows and minimum durations
 * already specified in the `BreakRequest`.
 * A `FrequencyConstraint` may in practice apply to non-consecutive breaks.
 * For example, the following schedule honors the "1h every 12h" example:
 * ```
 *   04:00 vehicle start
 *    .. performing travel and visits ..
 *   09:00 1 hour break
 *   10:00 end of the break
 *    .. performing travel and visits ..
 *   12:00 20-min lunch break
 *   12:20 end of the break
 *    .. performing travel and visits ..
 *   21:00 1 hour break
 *   22:00 end of the break
 *    .. performing travel and visits ..
 *   23:59 vehicle end
 * ```
