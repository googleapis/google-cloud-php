 * Service Description: A service for optimizing vehicle tours.
 *
 * Validity of certain types of fields:
 *
 * * `google.protobuf.Timestamp`
 * * Times are in Unix time: seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00.
 * * seconds must be in [0, 253402300799],
 * i.e. in [1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00].
 * * nanos must be unset or set to 0.
 * * `google.protobuf.Duration`
 * * seconds must be in [0, 253402300799],
 * i.e. in [1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00].
 * * nanos must be unset or set to 0.
 * * `google.type.LatLng`
 * * latitude must be in [-90.0, 90.0].
 * * longitude must be in [-180.0, 180.0].
 * * at least one of latitude and longitude must be non-zero.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * ```
 * $fleetRoutingClient = new FleetRoutingClient();
 * try {
 *     $parent = 'parent';
 *     $modelConfigs = [];
 *     $operationResponse = $fleetRoutingClient->batchOptimizeTours($parent, $modelConfigs);
 *     $operationResponse->pollUntilComplete();
 *     if ($operationResponse->operationSucceeded()) {
 *         $result = $operationResponse->getResult();
 *     // doSomethingWith($result)
 *     } else {
 *         $error = $operationResponse->getError();
 *         // handleError($error)
 *     }
 *     // Alternatively:
 *     // start the operation, keep the operation name, and resume later
 *     $operationResponse = $fleetRoutingClient->batchOptimizeTours($parent, $modelConfigs);
 *     $operationName = $operationResponse->getName();
 *     // ... do other work
 *     $newOperationResponse = $fleetRoutingClient->resumeOperation($operationName, 'batchOptimizeTours');
 *     while (!$newOperationResponse->isDone()) {
 *         // ... do other work

     *
     * A `ShipmentModel` model consists mainly of `Shipment`s that need to be
     * carried out and `Vehicle`s that can be used to transport the `Shipment`s.
     * The `ShipmentRoute`s assign `Shipment`s to `Vehicle`s. More specifically,
     * they assign a series of `Visit`s to each vehicle, where a `Visit`
     * corresponds to a `VisitRequest`, which is a pickup or delivery for a
     * `Shipment`.
     *
     * The goal is to provide an assignment of `ShipmentRoute`s to `Vehicle`s that
     * minimizes the total cost where cost has many components defined in the

     *           error detail (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_details),

     *     @type int $searchMode
     *           Search mode used to solve the request.
     *           For allowed values, use constants defined on {@see \Google\Cloud\Optimization\V1\OptimizeToursRequest\SearchMode}
     *     @type ShipmentRoute[] $injectedFirstSolutionRoutes
     *           Guide the optimization algorithm in finding a first solution that is
     *           similar to a previous solution.
     *
     *           The model is constrained when the first solution is built.
     *           Any shipments not performed on a route are implicitly skipped in the first
     *           solution, but they may be performed in successive solutions.
     *
     *           The solution must satisfy some basic validity assumptions:
     *
     *           * for all routes, `vehicle_index` must be in range and not be duplicated.
     *           * for all visits, `shipment_index` and `visit_request_index` must be
     *           in range.
     *           * a shipment may only be referenced on one route.
     *           * the pickup of a pickup-delivery shipment must be performed before
     *           the delivery.
     *           * no more than one pickup alternative or delivery alternative of
     *           a shipment may be performed.
     *           * for all routes, times are increasing (i.e., `vehicle_start_time
     *           <= visits[0].start_time <= visits[1].start_time ...
     *           <= vehicle_end_time`).
     *           * a shipment may only be performed on a vehicle that is allowed. A
     *           vehicle is allowed if
     *           [Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices]
     *           is empty or its `vehicle_index` is included in
     *           [Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices].
     *
     *           If the injected solution is not feasible, a validation error is not
     *           necessarily returned and an error indicating infeasibility may be returned
     *           instead.
     *     @type InjectedSolutionConstraint $injectedSolutionConstraint
     *           Constrain the optimization algorithm to find a final solution that is
     *           similar to a previous solution. For example, this may be used to freeze
     *           portions of routes which have already been completed or which are to be
     *           completed but must not be modified.
     *
     *           If the injected solution is not feasible, a validation error is not
     *           necessarily returned and an error indicating infeasibility may be returned
     *           instead.
     *     @type ShipmentRoute[] $refreshDetailsRoutes
     *           If non-empty, the given routes will be refreshed, without modifying their
     *           underlying sequence of visits or travel times: only other details will be
     *           updated. This does not solve the model.
     *
     *           As of 2020/11, this only populates the polylines of non-empty routes and
     *           requires that `populate_polylines` is true.
     *
     *           The `route_polyline` fields of the passed-in routes may be inconsistent

     *
     *           `Shipment.ignore` and `Vehicle.ignore` have no effect on the behavior.
     *           Polylines are still populated between all visits in all non-empty routes
     *           regardless of whether the related shipments or vehicles are ignored.
     *     @type bool $interpretInjectedSolutionsUsingLabels
     *           If true:
     *
     *           * uses
     *           [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label]
     *           instead of `vehicle_index` to
     *           match routes in an injected solution with vehicles in the request;
     *           reuses the mapping of original
     *           [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index]
     *           to new
     *           [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index]
     *           to update
     *           [ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.InjectedSolutionConstraint.ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices]
     *           if non-empty, but the mapping must be unambiguous (i.e., multiple
     *           `ShipmentRoute`s must not share the same original `vehicle_index`).
     *           * uses
     *           [ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label]
     *           instead of `shipment_index`
     *           to match visits in an injected solution with shipments in the request;
     *           * uses
     *           [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label]
     *           instead of
     *           [SkippedShipment.index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.index]
     *           to
     *           match skipped shipments in the injected solution with request
     *           shipments.
     *
     *           This interpretation applies to the `injected_first_solution_routes`,
     *           `injected_solution_constraint`, and `refresh_details_routes` fields.
     *           It can be used when shipment or vehicle indices in the request have
     *           changed since the solution was created, perhaps because shipments or
     *           vehicles have been removed from or added to the request.
     *
     *           If true, labels in the following categories must appear at most once in
     *           their category:
     *
     *           * [Vehicle.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Vehicle.label] in the
     *           request;
     *           * [Shipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.label] in the
     *           request;
     *           * [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label] in the injected solution;
     *           * [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label] and [ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label] in
     *           the injected solution (except pickup/delivery visit pairs, whose
     *           `shipment_label` must appear twice).
     *
     *           If a `vehicle_label` in the injected solution does not correspond to a
     *           request vehicle, the corresponding route is removed from the solution
     *           along with its visits. If a `shipment_label` in the injected solution does
     *           not correspond to a request shipment, the corresponding visit is removed
     *           from the solution. If a
     *           [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label]
     *           in the injected solution does not correspond to a request shipment, the
     *           `SkippedShipment` is removed from the solution.
     *
     *           Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may
     *           have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in
     *           solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.
     *
     *           NOTE: The caller must ensure that each
     *           [Vehicle.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Vehicle.label] (resp.
     *           [Shipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.label]) uniquely
     *           identifies a vehicle (resp. shipment) entity used across the two relevant
     *           requests: the past request that produced the `OptimizeToursResponse` used
     *           in the injected solution and the current request that includes the injected
     *           solution. The uniqueness checks described above are not enough to guarantee
     *           this requirement.

     *           If true, travel distances will be computed using geodesic distances instead
     *           of Google Maps distances, and travel times will be computed using geodesic
