     * If you specify `exclude_prefixes`, Storage Transfer Service uses the items
     * in the `exclude_prefixes` array to determine which objects to exclude from
     * a transfer. Objects must not start with one of the matching
     * `exclude_prefixes` for inclusion in a transfer.
     * The following are requirements of `exclude_prefixes`:
     *   * Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to
     *     a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain
     *     Carriage Return or Line Feed characters.  Wildcard matching and regular
     *     expression matching are not supported.
     *   * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to
     *     exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`,
     *     specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`.
     *   * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified.
     *   * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object
     *     namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another
     *     exclude-prefix.
     *   * If [include_prefixes][google.storagetransfer.v1.ObjectConditions.include_prefixes] is specified, then each exclude-prefix must
     *   start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`.
     * The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000.
