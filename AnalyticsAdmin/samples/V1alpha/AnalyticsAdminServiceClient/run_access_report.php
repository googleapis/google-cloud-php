/**
 * Returns a customized report of data access records. The report provides
 * records of each time a user reads Google Analytics reporting data. Access
 * records are retained for up to 2 years.
 *
 * Data Access Reports can be requested for a property. Reports may be
 * requested for any property, but dimensions that aren't related to quota can
 * only be requested on Google Analytics 360 properties. This method is only
 * available to Administrators.
 *
 * These data access records include GA4 UI Reporting, GA4 UI Explorations,
 * GA4 Data API, and other products like Firebase & Admob that can retrieve
 * data from Google Analytics through a linkage. These records don't include
 * property configuration changes like adding a stream or changing a
 * property's time zone. For configuration change history, see
 * [searchChangeHistoryEvents](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/rest/v1alpha/accounts/searchChangeHistoryEvents).
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
