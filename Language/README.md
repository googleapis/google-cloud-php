### Installation

$ composer require google/cloud-language
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Language\LanguageClient;

$language = new LanguageClient();

// Analyze a sentence.
$annotation = $language->annotateText('Greetings from Michigan!');

// Check the sentiment.
if ($annotation->sentiment() > 0) {
    echo "This is a positive message.\n";
}

// Detect entities.
$entities = $annotation->entitiesByType('LOCATION');

foreach ($entities as $entity) {
    echo $entity['name'] . "\n";
}

// Parse the syntax.
$tokens = $annotation->tokensByTag('NOUN');

foreach ($tokens as $token) {
    echo $token['text']['content'] . "\n";
}
```
