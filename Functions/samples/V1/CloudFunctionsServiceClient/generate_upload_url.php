/**
 * Returns a signed URL for uploading a function source code.
 * For more information about the signed URL usage see:
 * https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls.
 * Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed
 * URL should be provided in CreateFunction or UpdateFunction request
 * as a reference to the function source code.
 *
 * When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
 * these restrictions:
 *
 * * Source file type should be a zip file.
 * * Source file size should not exceed 100MB limit.
 * * No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
 * target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
 * attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
 * identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.
 *
 * When making an HTTP PUT request, these two headers must be specified:
 *
 * * `content-type: application/zip`
 * * `x-goog-content-length-range: 0,104857600`
 *
 * And this header must NOT be specified:
 *
 * * `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
