/**
 * Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on
 * specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row to include
 * just the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might
 * return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters
 * can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, "within
 * every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells
 * which are older than timestamp X."
 * There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
 * as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
 * (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
 * * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
 * from the output row. An example of a true filter is the `value_regex_filter`,
 * which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
 * regex true filters use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
 * in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
 * important point to keep in mind is that `RE2(.)` is equivalent by default to
 * `RE2([^\n])`, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to
 * match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence `\C`,
 * which may need to be further escaped as `\\C` in your client language.
 * * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
 * cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
 * supported transformer is the `strip_value_transformer`, which replaces every
 * cell's value with the empty string.
 * * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
 * RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
 * The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
 * exceed 4096 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
 * (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.
