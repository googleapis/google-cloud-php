support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to
that project.

### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-recommendations-ai
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
use Google\Cloud\RecommendationEngine\V1beta1\PredictionServiceClient;
use Google\Cloud\RecommendationEngine\V1beta1\UserEvent;

$client = new PredictionServiceClient();
$formattedName = $predictionServiceClient->placementName(
    '[PROJECT]',
    '[LOCATION]',
    '[CATALOG]',
    '[EVENT_STORE]',
    '[PLACEMENT]'
);
$userEvent = new UserEvent();

$predictions = $predictionServiceClient->predict($formattedName, $userEvent);
```

### Version

This component is considered beta. As such, it should be expected to be mostly stable and we're working towards a release candidate. We will address issues and requests with a higher priority.

### Next Steps
