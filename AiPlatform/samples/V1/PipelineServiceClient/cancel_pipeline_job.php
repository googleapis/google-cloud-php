/**
 * Cancels a PipelineJob.
 * Starts asynchronous cancellation on the PipelineJob. The server
 * makes a best effort to cancel the pipeline, but success is not
 * guaranteed. Clients can use [PipelineService.GetPipelineJob][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineService.GetPipelineJob] or
 * other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
 * pipeline completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
 * the PipelineJob is not deleted; instead it becomes a pipeline with
 * a [PipelineJob.error][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineJob.error] value with a [google.rpc.Status.code][google.rpc.Status.code] of 1,
 * corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and [PipelineJob.state][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineJob.state] is set to
 * `CANCELLED`.
 *
 * @param string $formattedName The name of the PipelineJob to cancel.
 *                              Format:
 *                              `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/pipelineJobs/{pipeline_job}`
 *                              Please see {@see PipelineServiceClient::pipelineJobName()} for help formatting this field.
