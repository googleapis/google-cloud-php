     * Query string that is a conjunction of field-restricted queries and/or
     * field-restricted filters.  Field-restricted queries and filters can be
     * combined using `AND` to form a conjunction.
     * A field query is in the form FIELD:QUERY. This implicitly checks if QUERY
     * exists as a substring within Feature's FIELD. The QUERY
     * and the FIELD are converted to a sequence of words (i.e. tokens) for
     * comparison. This is done by:
     *   * Removing leading/trailing whitespace and tokenizing the search value.
     *   Characters that are not one of alphanumeric `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, underscore
     *   `_`, or asterisk `*` are treated as delimiters for tokens. `*` is treated
     *   as a wildcard that matches characters within a token.
     *   * Ignoring case.
     *   * Prepending an asterisk to the first and appending an asterisk to the
     *   last token in QUERY.
     * A QUERY must be either a singular token or a phrase. A phrase is one or
     * multiple words enclosed in double quotation marks ("). With phrases, the
     * order of the words is important. Words in the phrase must be matching in
     * order and consecutively.
     * Supported FIELDs for field-restricted queries:
     * * `feature_id`
     * * `description`
     * * `entity_type_id`
     * Examples:
     * * `feature_id: foo` --> Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring
     * `foo` (eg. `foo`, `foofeature`, `barfoo`).
     * * `feature_id: foo*feature` --> Matches a Feature with ID containing the
     * substring `foo*feature` (eg. `foobarfeature`).
     * * `feature_id: foo AND description: bar` --> Matches a Feature with ID
     * containing the substring `foo` and description containing the substring
     * `bar`.
     * Besides field queries, the following exact-match filters are
     * supported. The exact-match filters do not support wildcards. Unlike
     * field-restricted queries, exact-match filters are case-sensitive.
     * * `feature_id`: Supports = comparisons.
     * * `description`: Supports = comparisons. Multi-token filters should be
     * enclosed in quotes.
     * * `entity_type_id`: Supports = comparisons.
     * * `value_type`: Supports = and != comparisons.
     * * `labels`: Supports key-value equality as well as key presence.
     * * `featurestore_id`: Supports = comparisons.
     * Examples:
     * * `description = "foo bar"` --> Any Feature with description exactly equal
     * to `foo bar`
     * * `value_type = DOUBLE` --> Features whose type is DOUBLE.
     * * `labels.active = yes AND labels.env = prod` --> Features having both
     *     (active: yes) and (env: prod) labels.
     * * `labels.env: *` --> Any Feature which has a label with `env` as the
