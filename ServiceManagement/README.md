support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to

### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-service-management
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Version

This component is considered beta. As such, it should be expected to be mostly
stable and we're working towards a release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.

### Next Steps

1. Understand the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-management/docs).
