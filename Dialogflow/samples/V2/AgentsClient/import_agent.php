/**
 * Imports the specified agent from a ZIP file.
 *
 * Uploads new intents and entity types without deleting the existing ones.
 * Intents and entity types with the same name are replaced with the new
 * versions from [ImportAgentRequest][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.ImportAgentRequest]. After the import, the imported draft
 * agent will be trained automatically (unless disabled in agent settings).
 * However, once the import is done, training may not be completed yet. Please
 * call [TrainAgent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Agents.TrainAgent] and wait for the operation it returns in order to train
 * explicitly.
 *
 * This method is a [long-running
 * operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/long-running-operations).
 * The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields:
 *
 * - `metadata`: An empty [Struct
 * message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct)
 * - `response`: An [Empty
 * message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#empty)
 *
 * The operation only tracks when importing is complete, not when it is done
 * training.
 *
 * Note: You should always train an agent prior to sending it queries. See the
 * [training
 * documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/training).
 *
 * @param string $formattedParent The project that the agent to import is associated with.
 *                                Format: `projects/<Project ID>`. Please see
 *                                {@see AgentsClient::projectName()} for help formatting this field.
