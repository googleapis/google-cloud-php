/**
 * Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify
 * the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the
 * `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account.
 * Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the
 * project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a
 * billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource
 * usage charges.
 *
 * *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction
 * history of the Google Cloud Console might be billed to the new billing
 * account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was
 * assigned to the project.
 *
 * The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both
 * the
 * [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo
 * ) and the [billing
 * account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access).
 *
 * You can disable billing on the project by setting the
 * `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the
 * current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your
 * in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as
 * expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously
 * associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner
 * of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project.
 *
 * Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have
 * much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid
 * resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to
 * disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an
 * *open* billing account.
 *
 * @param string $name The resource name of the project associated with the billing
 *                     information that you want to update. For example,
 *                     `projects/tokyo-rain-123`.
