/**
 * This method creates [billing
 * subaccounts](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts#subaccounts).
 *
 * Google Cloud resellers should use the
 * Channel Services APIs,
 * [accounts.customers.create](https://cloud.google.com/channel/docs/reference/rest/v1/accounts.customers/create)
 * and
 * [accounts.customers.entitlements.create](https://cloud.google.com/channel/docs/reference/rest/v1/accounts.customers.entitlements/create).
 *
 * When creating a subaccount, the current authenticated user must have the
 * `billing.accounts.update` IAM permission on the parent account, which is
 * typically given to billing account
 * [administrators](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access).
 * This method will return an error if the parent account has not been
 * provisioned for subaccounts.
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
