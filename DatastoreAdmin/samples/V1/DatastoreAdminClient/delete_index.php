/**
 * Deletes an existing index.
 * An index can only be deleted if it is in a `READY` or `ERROR` state. On
 * successful execution of the request, the index will be in a `DELETING`
 * [state][google.datastore.admin.v1.Index.State]. And on completion of the
 * returned [google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation], the index will be removed.
 *
 * During index deletion, the process could result in an error, in which
 * case the index will move to the `ERROR` state. The process can be recovered
 * by fixing the data that caused the error, followed by calling
 * [delete][google.datastore.admin.v1.DatastoreAdmin.DeleteIndex] again.
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code

 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
