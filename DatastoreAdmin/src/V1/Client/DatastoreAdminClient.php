/**
 * Service Description: Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
 *
 * The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
 *
 * Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google Cloud
 * Datastore API.
 *
 * Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
 *
 * EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
 * specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
 * may be all).
 *
 * Export/Import Service:
 *
 * - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
 * entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
 * - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
 * Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
 * possible to export from one project and then import into another.
 * - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
 * - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
 * created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
 * of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
 *
 * Index Service:
 *
 * - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
 * - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
 * An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
 * The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
 * may be queried via the Operation resource.
 *
 * Operation Service:
 *
 * - The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
 * specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
 * created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
 * - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel
 * is asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after the
 * request to cancel is made.
 * - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
 * part of the Operation collection.
 * - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed
 * operations.
 * - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are accessed via
 * service google.longrunning.Operations.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods.

     *           The address of the API remote host. May optionally include the port, formatted
     *           as "<uri>:<port>". Default 'datastore.googleapis.com:443'.
     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials

     *           PHP array.
     *           *Advanced usage*: In addition, this option can also accept a pre-constructed
     *           {@see \Google\Auth\FetchAuthTokenInterface} object or
     *           {@see \Google\ApiCore\CredentialsWrapper} object. Note that when one of these
     *           objects are provided, any settings in $credentialsConfig will be ignored.
     *           *Important*: If you accept a credential configuration (credential
     *           JSON/File/Stream) from an external source for authentication to Google Cloud
     *           Platform, you must validate it before providing it to any Google API or library.
     *           Providing an unvalidated credential configuration to Google APIs can compromise
     *           the security of your systems and data. For more information {@see
     *           https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials}

     *           Determines whether or not retries defined by the client configuration should be
     *           disabled. Defaults to `false`.
     *     @type string|array $clientConfig
     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either
     *           a path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data. By
     *           default this settings points to the default client config file, which is
     *           provided in the resources folder.
     *     @type string|TransportInterface $transport
     *           The transport used for executing network requests. May be either the string
     *           `rest` or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already
     *           instantiated {@see \Google\ApiCore\Transport\TransportInterface} object. Note
     *           that when this object is provided, any settings in $transportConfig, and any
     *           $apiEndpoint setting, will be ignored.
     *     @type array $transportConfig
     *           Configuration options that will be used to construct the transport. Options for
     *           each supported transport type should be passed in a key for that transport. For
     *           example:
     *           $transportConfig = [
     *               'grpc' => [...],

     *           supported options.
     *     @type callable $clientCertSource
     *           A callable which returns the client cert as a string. This can be used to
     *           provide a certificate and private key to the transport layer for mTLS.
     *     @type false|LoggerInterface $logger
     *           A PSR-3 compliant logger. If set to false, logging is disabled, ignoring the
