 * Service Description: BigQuery Write API.
 *
 * The Write API can be used to write data to BigQuery.
 *
 * For supplementary information about the Write API, see:
 * https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods.
 *
 * Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To
 * assist with these names, this class includes a format method for each type of
 * name, and additionally a parseName method to extract the individual identifiers
 * contained within formatted names that are returned by the API.
 *
 * @method PromiseInterface<BatchCommitWriteStreamsResponse> batchCommitWriteStreamsAsync(BatchCommitWriteStreamsRequest $request, array $optionalArgs = [])
 * @method PromiseInterface<WriteStream> createWriteStreamAsync(CreateWriteStreamRequest $request, array $optionalArgs = [])

     *           The transport used for executing network requests. May be either the string
     *           `rest` or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already
