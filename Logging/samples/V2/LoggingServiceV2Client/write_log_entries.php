/**
 * Writes log entries to Logging. This API method is the
 * only way to send log entries to Logging. This method
 * is used, directly or indirectly, by the Logging agent
 * (fluentd) and all logging libraries configured to use Logging.
 * A single request may contain log entries for a maximum of 1000
 * different resources (projects, organizations, billing accounts or
 * folders)
 *
 * @param string $entriesLogName The resource name of the log to which this log entry belongs:
 *
 *                               "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *                               "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *                               "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *                               "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *
 *                               A project number may be used in place of PROJECT_ID. The project number is
 *                               translated to its corresponding PROJECT_ID internally and the `log_name`
 *                               field will contain PROJECT_ID in queries and exports.
 *
 *                               `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded within `log_name`. Example:
 *                               `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
 *
 *                               `[LOG_ID]` must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the
 *                               following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters,
 *                               forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.
 *
 *                               For backward compatibility, if `log_name` begins with a forward-slash, such
 *                               as `/projects/...`, then the log entry is ingested as usual, but the
 *                               forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading
 *                               slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return
 *                               any results.
