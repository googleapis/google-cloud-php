/**
 * Creates a sink that exports specified log entries to a destination. The
 * export of newly-ingested log entries begins immediately, unless the sink's
 * `writer_identity` is not permitted to write to the destination. A sink can
 * export log entries only from the resource owning the sink.
 *
 * @param string $formattedParent The resource in which to create the sink:
 *
 *                                "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
 *                                "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
 *                                "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
 *                                "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
 *
 *                                For examples:
 *
 *                                `"projects/my-project"`
 *                                `"organizations/123456789"`
 *                                Please see {@see ConfigServiceV2Client::projectName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $sinkName        The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.
 *
 *                                For example: `"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub"`. Sink identifiers are limited
 *                                to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and
 *                                lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
 *                                First character has to be alphanumeric.
 * @param string $sinkDestination The export destination:
 *
 *                                "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
 *                                "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
 *                                "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
 *
 *                                The sink's `writer_identity`, set when the sink is created, must have
 *                                permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not
 *                                exported. For more information, see
 *                                [Exporting Logs with
 *                                Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
