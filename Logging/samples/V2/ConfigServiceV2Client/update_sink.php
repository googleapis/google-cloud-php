/**
 * Updates a sink. This method replaces the following fields in the existing
 * sink with values from the new sink: `destination`, and `filter`.
 *
 * The updated sink might also have a new `writer_identity`; see the
 * `unique_writer_identity` field.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSinkName The full resource name of the sink to update, including the parent
 *                                  resource and the sink identifier:
 *
 *                                  "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
 *                                  "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
 *                                  "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
 *                                  "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
 *
 *                                  For example:
 *
 *                                  `"projects/my-project/sinks/my-sink"`
 *                                  Please see {@see ConfigServiceV2Client::logSinkName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $sinkName          The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.
 *
 *                                  For example: `"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub"`. Sink identifiers are limited
 *                                  to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and
 *                                  lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
 *                                  First character has to be alphanumeric.
 * @param string $sinkDestination   The export destination:
 *
 *                                  "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
 *                                  "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
 *                                  "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
 *
 *                                  The sink's `writer_identity`, set when the sink is created, must have
 *                                  permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not
 *                                  exported. For more information, see
 *                                  [Exporting Logs with
 *                                  Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
