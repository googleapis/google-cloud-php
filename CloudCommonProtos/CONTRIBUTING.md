We are pleased that you are interested in contributing to our work.

### Generated Protocol Buffer Classes

The classes in this repository are generated by the protocol buffer
compiler, also known as protoc. As such, we can not accept contributions
directly to these generated classes. Instead, changes should be
suggested upstream in the [Googleapis][googleapis]
repository.


### Documentation

We want for both protocol buffers and the types that we have provided here
to be understandable to everyone, including to those who may be unfamiliar
with the ecosystem or concepts.

That means we want our documentation to be better, and welcome anyone
willing to help with this. For documentation in the generated classes, please
open a pull request against the [Googleapis][googleapis]
repository.

Any improvements to READMEs or other non-generated documentation or
development scripts in this repository would be greatly appreciated - please
open a pull request.
