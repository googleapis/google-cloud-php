If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation.

If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time.

If the field masks include [job_end_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.job_end_time], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time.

The\nexpired job can't be listed by the [ListJobs][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobService.ListJobs] API,\nbut it can be retrieved with the [GetJob][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobService.GetJob] API or\nupdated with the [UpdateJob][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobService.UpdateJob] API or deleted with\nthe [DeleteJob][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobService.DeleteJob] API. An expired job can\nbe updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp.\nUpdating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with\nsame [company][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.company], [language_code][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.language_code] and [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.requisition_id].\nThe expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the\noverall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of\nopen jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded,\nexpired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time.\nExpired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned\nout.\nInvalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.\nIf the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job\nis treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can\nnot be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the\n[posting_publish_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.posting_publish_time] must be set before\n[posting_expire_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.posting_expire_time]. The purpose of this feature is\nto allow other objects, such as [Application][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Application], to refer a job\nthat didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you\nwant to modify a job that was expired on creation,\ndelete it and create a new one.\nIf this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,\nthe job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For\nexample, if the job was created on 2017\/01\/01 13:00AM UTC with an\nunspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017\/01\/31 13:00AM UTC.\nIf this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include\n[job_end_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.job_end_time], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.<\/p>\n","types":["<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.13.0\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Timestamp.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Timestamp<\/a>"],"optional":false,"nullable":null}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"cloud-talent\/v0.14.0\/talent\/v4beta1\/job\">Google\\Cloud\\Talent\\V4beta1\\Job<\/a>"],"description":""}]},{"id":"getPostingCreateTime","type":"instance","name":"getPostingCreateTime","source":"Talent\/src\/V4beta1\/Job.php#L1486","description":"<p>Output only.
