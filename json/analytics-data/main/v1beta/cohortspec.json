For\nexample, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first\nweek of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting\nthe users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the\n<code>cohort<\/code> object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in\nthe <code>cohortsRange<\/code> object.\nFor examples, see <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/analytics\/devguides\/reporting\/data\/v1\/advanced#cohort_report_examples\">Cohort Report\nExamples<\/a>.\nThe report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has\nretained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after\nsix weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric\n<code>cohortActiveUsers\/cohortTotalUsers<\/code> and will be separate rows in the report.<\/p>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>google.analytics.data.v1beta.CohortSpec<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.10\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
