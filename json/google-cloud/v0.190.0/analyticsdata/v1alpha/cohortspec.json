For example, you could select the cohort of users\nthat were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for\nthe next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of\nSeptember cohort is specified in the <code>cohort<\/code> object. Following that\ncohort for the next six weeks is specified in the <code>cohortsRange<\/code> object.\nThe report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has\nretained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after\nsix weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric\n<code>cohortActiveUsers\/cohortTotalUsers<\/code> and will be separate rows in the report.<\/p>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>google.analytics.data.v1alpha.CohortSpec<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.21.7\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
