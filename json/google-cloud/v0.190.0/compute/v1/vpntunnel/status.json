Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel, ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel. - FIRST_HANDSHAKE: Successful first handshake with the peer VPN. - ESTABLISHED: Secure session is successfully established with the peer VPN. - NETWORK_ERROR: Deprecated, replaced by NO_INCOMING_PACKETS - AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: Auth error (for example, bad shared secret). - NEGOTIATION_FAILURE: Handshake failed. - DEPROVISIONING: Resources are being deallocated for the VPN tunnel. - FAILED: Tunnel creation has failed and the tunnel is not ready to be used. - NO_INCOMING_PACKETS: No incoming packets from peer. - REJECTED: Tunnel configuration was rejected, can be result of being denied access. - ALLOCATING_RESOURCES: Cloud VPN is in the process of allocating all required resources. - STOPPED: Tunnel is stopped due to its Forwarding Rules being deleted for Classic VPN tunnels or the project is in frozen state. - PEER_IDENTITY_MISMATCH: Peer identity does not match peer IP, probably behind NAT. - TS_NARROWING_NOT_ALLOWED: Traffic selector narrowing not allowed for an HA-VPN tunnel.<\/p>\n<p>Protobuf type <code>google.cloud.compute.v1.VpnTunnel.Status<\/code><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
