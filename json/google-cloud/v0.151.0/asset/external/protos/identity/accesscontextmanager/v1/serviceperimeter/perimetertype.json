There are two types: regular and\nbridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels, and\nrestricted services. Every resource can be in at most ONE\nregular Service Perimeter.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also\nbe in zero or more perimeter bridges.  A perimeter bridge only contains\nresources.  Cross project operations are permitted if all effected\nresources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter\nBridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed\nentirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.\nPerimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex toplogies\nwith many independent perimeters that need to share some data with a common\nperimeter, but should not be able to share data among themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Protobuf type <code>google.identity.accesscontextmanager.v1.ServicePerimeter.PerimeterType<\/code><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
