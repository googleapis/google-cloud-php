This can happen for     |                             |\n|    many reasons, for example when   |                             |\n|    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |\n|    event's destination before the   |                             |\n|    start of its time window         |                             |\n|                                     |                             |\n|  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |\n|    arrival.

Thus, it suffice to know the\ndelay duration to know its start and end time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The\nresponse specifies the start time and duration of each break.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>TRAVEL and WAIT are &quot;preemptable&quot;: they can be interrupted several times\nduring this transition.
