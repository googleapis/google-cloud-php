{"id":"monitoring\/v3\/aggregation","type":"","title":"Google\\Cloud\\Monitoring\\V3\\Aggregation","name":"Aggregation","description":"<p>Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of\nthe data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time\nseries in the set is <em>aligned<\/em> to the same time interval boundaries, then the\nset of time series is optionally <em>reduced<\/em> in number.<\/p>\n<p>Alignment consists of applying the <code>per_series_aligner<\/code> operation\nto each time series after its data has been divided into regular\n<code>alignment_period<\/code> time intervals. This process takes <em>all<\/em> of the data\npoints in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as\naveraging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single\ndata point per period.\nReduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be\ncombined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical\ntransformations. Reduction involves applying a <code>cross_series_reducer<\/code> to\nall the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with\n<code>group_by_fields<\/code>, and applying the reducer to each subset.\nThe raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from\nmultiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into\na more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the\n95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This\nrepresentative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the\nindividual time series data is still available for later drilldown.
