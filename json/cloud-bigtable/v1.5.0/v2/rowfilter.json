{"id":"bigtable\/v2\/rowfilter","type":"","title":"Google\\Cloud\\Bigtable\\V2\\RowFilter","name":"RowFilter","description":"<p>Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on\nspecified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row to include\njust the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might\nreturn all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters\ncan be composed out of these components to express requests such as, &quot;within\nevery column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells\nwhich are older than timestamp X.&quot;\nThere are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),\nas well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones\n(chains and interleaves). They work as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale\nfrom the output row. An example of a true filter is the <code>value_regex_filter<\/code>,\nwhich excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All\nregex true filters use RE2 syntax (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/google\/re2\/wiki\/Syntax\">https:\/\/github.com\/google\/re2\/wiki\/Syntax<\/a>)\nin raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An\nimportant point to keep in mind is that <code>RE2(.)<\/code> is equivalent by default to\n<code>RE2([^\\n])<\/code>, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to\nmatch an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence <code>\\C<\/code>,\nwhich may need to be further escaped as <code>\\\\C<\/code> in your client language.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its\ncells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only\nsupported transformer is the <code>strip_value_transformer<\/code>, which replaces every\ncell's value with the empty string.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the\nRowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.\nThe total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not\nexceed 4096 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other\n(in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Generated from protobuf message <code>google.bigtable.v2.RowFilter<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/protocolbuffers\/protobuf-php\/tree\/v3.13.0\/src\/Google\/Protobuf\/Internal\/Message.php\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[{"id":"__construct","type":"constructor","name":"__construct","source":"Bigtable\/src\/V2\/RowFilter.php#L191","description":"<p>Constructor.<\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"params":[{"name":"data","description":"<p>Optional.
