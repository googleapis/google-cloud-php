The given text\nis expected to be annotated exhaustively, for example, if you look\nfor animals and text contains &quot;dolphin&quot; that is not labeled, then\n&quot;dolphin&quot; is assumed to not be an animal. Any given text snippet\ncontent must be 10KB or smaller, and also be UTF-8 NFC encoded\n(ASCII already is).\nThe document .JSONL file contains, per line, a proto that wraps a\nDocument proto. The Document proto must have either document_text\nor input_config set.

In input_config case,\nonly PDF documents are supported now, and each document may be up\nto 2MB large.

Used e.g. to track two cars on\na video while being able to tell apart which one is which.\nBOUNDING_BOX = VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX | VERTEX,,,VERTEX,,\nA rectangle parallel to the frame of the example (image,\nvideo). If 4 vertices are given they are connected by edges\nin the order provided, if 2 are given they are recognized\nas diagonally opposite vertices of the rectangle.\nVERTEX = COORDINATE,COORDINATE\nFirst coordinate is horizontal (x), the second is vertical (y).\nCOORDINATE = A float in 0 to 1 range, relative to total length of\nimage or video in given dimension. For fractions the\nleading non-decimal 0 can be omitted (i.e. 0.3 = .3).\nPoint 0,0 is in top left.\nTIME_SEGMENT_START = TIME_OFFSET\nExpresses a beginning, inclusive, of a time segment\nwithin an example that has a time dimension\n(e.g. video).\nTIME_SEGMENT_END = TIME_OFFSET\nExpresses an end, exclusive, of a time segment within\nan example that has a time dimension (e.g. video).\nTIME_OFFSET = A number of seconds as measured from the start of an\nexample (e.g. video). Fractions are allowed, up to a\nmicrosecond precision. &quot;inf&quot; is allowed, and it means the end\nof the example.\nTEXT_SNIPPET = A content of a text snippet, UTF-8 encoded, enclosed within\ndouble quotes (&quot;&quot;).\nSENTIMENT = An integer between 0 and\nDataset.text_sentiment_dataset_metadata.sentiment_max\n(inclusive). Describes the ordinal of the sentiment - higher\nvalue means a more positive sentiment. All the values are\ncompletely relative, i.e. neither 0 needs to mean a negative or\nneutral sentiment nor sentiment_max needs to mean a positive one\n<ul>\n<li>it is just required that 0 is the least positive sentiment\nin the data, and sentiment_max is the  most positive one.\nThe SENTIMENT shouldn't be confused with &quot;score&quot; or &quot;magnitude&quot;\nfrom the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API.\nAll SENTIMENT values between 0 and sentiment_max must be\nrepresented in the imported data. On prediction the same 0 to\nsentiment_max range will be used. The difference between\nneighboring sentiment values needs not to be uniform, e.g. 1 and\n2 may be similar whereas the difference between 2 and 3 may be\nhuge.\nErrors:\nIf any of the provided CSV files can't be parsed or if more than certain\npercent of CSV rows cannot be processed then the operation fails and\nnothing is imported.
