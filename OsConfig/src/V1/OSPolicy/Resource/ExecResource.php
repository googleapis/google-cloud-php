/**
 * A resource that allows executing scripts on the VM.
 * The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages
 * accept a script as an argument to execute.
 * When the `ExecResource` is applied by the agent, it first executes the
 * script in the `validate` stage. The `validate` stage can signal that the
 * `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code
 * of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should
 * return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage
 * is considered an error.
 * If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code
 * from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from
 * the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired
 * state, the `enforce` stage will not be run.
 * Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit
 * code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state.
 * Any other exit code is considered an error.
 * NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to
 * have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state`
 * and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit
 * code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script. So, for
 * reasons of consistency and being explicit, exit codes `100` and `101`
 * were chosen.
