/**
 * Reports operation results to Google Service Control, such as logs and
 * metrics. It should be called after an operation is completed.
 *
 * If feasible, the client should aggregate reporting data for up to 5
 * seconds to reduce API traffic. Limiting aggregation to 5 seconds is to
 * reduce data loss during client crashes. Clients should carefully choose
 * the aggregation time window to avoid data loss risk more than 0.01%
 * for business and compliance reasons.
 *
 * NOTE: the [ReportRequest][google.api.servicecontrol.v1.ReportRequest] has
 * the size limit (wire-format byte size) of 1MB.
 *
 * This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.report` permission
 * on the specified service. For more information, see
 * [Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
