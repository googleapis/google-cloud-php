/**
 * Checks whether an operation on a service should be allowed to proceed
 * based on the configuration of the service and related policies. It must be
 * called before the operation is executed.
 *
 * If feasible, the client should cache the check results and reuse them for
 * 60 seconds. In case of any server errors, the client should rely on the
 * cached results for much longer time to avoid outage.
 * WARNING: There is general 60s delay for the configuration and policy
 * propagation, therefore callers MUST NOT depend on the `Check` method having
 * the latest policy information.
 *
 * NOTE: the [CheckRequest][google.api.servicecontrol.v1.CheckRequest] has
 * the size limit (wire-format byte size) of 1MB.
 *
 * This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission
 * on the specified service. For more information, see
 * [Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
