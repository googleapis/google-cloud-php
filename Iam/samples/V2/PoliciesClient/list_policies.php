/**
 * Retrieves the policies of the specified kind that are attached to a

 * The response lists only policy metadata. In particular, policy rules are

 * @param string $parent The resource that the policy is attached to, along with the kind of policy
 *                       to list. Format:
 *                       `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies`
 *
 *
 *                       The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name,
 *                       which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as
 *                       `%2F`. For example,
 *                       `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies`.
 *
 *                       For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource
 *                       name. For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID.
