**NOTE:** This repository is part of [Google Cloud PHP](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php). Any
support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to
that project.

Stackdriver Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications.

### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-monitoring
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
use Google\Api\Metric;
use Google\Api\MonitoredResource;
use Google\Cloud\Monitoring\V3\MetricServiceClient;
use Google\Cloud\Monitoring\V3\Point;
use Google\Cloud\Monitoring\V3\TimeInterval;
use Google\Cloud\Monitoring\V3\TimeSeries;
use Google\Cloud\Monitoring\V3\TypedValue;
use Google\Protobuf\Timestamp;

$metricServiceClient = new MetricServiceClient();
$formattedProjectName = $metricServiceClient->projectName($projectId);
$labels = [
    'instance_id' => $instanceId,
    'zone' => $zone,
];

$m = new Metric();
$m->setType('custom.googleapis.com/my_metric');

$r = new MonitoredResource();
$r->setType('gce_instance');
$r->setLabels($labels);

$value = new TypedValue();
$value->setDoubleValue(3.14);

$timestamp = new Timestamp();
$timestamp->setSeconds(time());

$interval = new TimeInterval();
$interval->setStartTime($timestamp);
$interval->setEndTime($timestamp);

$point = new Point();
$point->setValue($value);
$point->setInterval($interval);
$points = [$point];

$timeSeries = new TimeSeries();
$timeSeries->setMetric($m);
$timeSeries->setResource($r);
$timeSeries->setPoints($points);

try {
    $metricServiceClient->createTimeSeries($formattedProjectName, [$timeSeries]);
    print('Successfully submitted a time series' . PHP_EOL);
} finally {
    $metricServiceClient->close();
}
```

### Version

This component is considered GA (generally available). As such, it will not introduce backwards-incompatible changes in
any minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests with the highest priority.

### Next Steps

1. Understand the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/).
2. Take a look at [in-depth usage samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docs-samples/tree/master/monitoring/).
