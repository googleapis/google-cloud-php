 * Represents a value with a data type of

 * Nanosecond precision is preserved by passing nanoseconds as a separate

 * precision in the timestamp will be overridden when encoding the timestamp
 * as a string.

 * Example:
 * ```
 * use Google\Cloud\Spanner\SpannerClient;
 *
 * $spanner = new SpannerClient(['projectId' => 'my-project']);
 *
 * $timestamp = $spanner->timestamp(new \DateTime('2003-02-05 11:15:02.421827Z'));

 * ```

 * echo (string) $timestamp;
