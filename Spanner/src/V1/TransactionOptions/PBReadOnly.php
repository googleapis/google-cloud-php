     *           Read at a timestamp where all previously committed transactions
     *           are visible.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $min_read_timestamp
     *           Executes all reads at a timestamp >= `min_read_timestamp`.
     *           This is useful for requesting fresher data than some previous
     *           read, or data that is fresh enough to observe the effects of some
     *           previously committed transaction whose timestamp is known.
     *           Note that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.
     *           A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to nanoseconds.
     *           Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Duration $max_staleness
     *           Read data at a timestamp >= `NOW - max_staleness`
     *           seconds. Guarantees that all writes that have committed more
     *           than the specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because
     *           Cloud Spanner chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if
     *           the client's local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner
     *           commit timestamps.
     *           Useful for reading the freshest data available at a nearby
     *           replica, while bounding the possible staleness if the local
     *           replica has fallen behind.
     *           Note that this option can only be used in single-use
     *           transactions.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $read_timestamp
     *           Executes all reads at the given timestamp. Unlike other modes,
     *           reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable; the same read at
     *           the same timestamp always returns the same data. If the
     *           timestamp is in the future, the read will block until the
     *           specified timestamp, modulo the read's deadline.
     *           Useful for large scale consistent reads such as mapreduces, or
     *           for coordinating many reads against a consistent snapshot of the
     *           data.
     *           A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to nanoseconds.
     *           Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Duration $exact_staleness
     *           Executes all reads at a timestamp that is `exact_staleness`
     *           old. The timestamp is chosen soon after the read is started.
     *           Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the
     *           specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud Spanner

     *           local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner commit
     *           timestamps.

     *           timestamp negotiation overhead of `max_staleness`.
