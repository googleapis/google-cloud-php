/**
 * Creates a new session. A session can be used to perform
 * transactions that read and/or modify data in a Cloud Spanner database.
 * Sessions are meant to be reused for many consecutive
 * transactions.
 *
 * Sessions can only execute one transaction at a time. To execute
 * multiple concurrent read-write/write-only transactions, create
 * multiple sessions. Note that standalone reads and queries use a
 * transaction internally, and count toward the one transaction
 * limit.
 *
 * Active sessions use additional server resources, so it is a good idea to
 * delete idle and unneeded sessions.
 * Aside from explicit deletes, Cloud Spanner may delete sessions for which no
 * operations are sent for more than an hour. If a session is deleted,
 * requests to it return `NOT_FOUND`.
 *
 * Idle sessions can be kept alive by sending a trivial SQL query
 * periodically, e.g., `"SELECT 1"`.
 *
 * @param string $formattedDatabase The database in which the new session is created. Please see
 *                                  {@see SpannerClient::databaseName()} for help formatting this field.
