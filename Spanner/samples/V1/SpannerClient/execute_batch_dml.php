/**
 * Executes a batch of SQL DML statements. This method allows many statements
 * to be run with lower latency than submitting them sequentially with
 * [ExecuteSql][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.ExecuteSql].
 *
 * Statements are executed in sequential order. A request can succeed even if
 * a statement fails. The
 * [ExecuteBatchDmlResponse.status][google.spanner.v1.ExecuteBatchDmlResponse.status]
 * field in the response provides information about the statement that failed.
 * Clients must inspect this field to determine whether an error occurred.
 *
 * Execution stops after the first failed statement; the remaining statements
 * are not executed.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSession The session in which the DML statements should be performed. Please see
 *                                 {@see SpannerClient::sessionName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $statementsSql    The DML string.
 * @param int    $seqno            A per-transaction sequence number used to identify this request.
 *                                 This field makes each request idempotent such that if the request is
 *                                 received multiple times, at most one will succeed.
 *
 *                                 The sequence number must be monotonically increasing within the
 *                                 transaction. If a request arrives for the first time with an out-of-order
 *                                 sequence number, the transaction may be aborted. Replays of previously
 *                                 handled requests will yield the same response as the first execution.
