/**
 * Creates a set of partition tokens that can be used to execute a query
 * operation in parallel.  Each of the returned partition tokens can be used
 * by [ExecuteStreamingSql][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.ExecuteStreamingSql] to
 * specify a subset of the query result to read.  The same session and
 * read-only transaction must be used by the PartitionQueryRequest used to
 * create the partition tokens and the ExecuteSqlRequests that use the
 * partition tokens.
 *
 * Partition tokens become invalid when the session used to create them
 * is deleted, is idle for too long, begins a new transaction, or becomes too
 * old.  When any of these happen, it is not possible to resume the query, and
 * the whole operation must be restarted from the beginning.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSession The session used to create the partitions. Please see
 *                                 {@see SpannerClient::sessionName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $sql              The query request to generate partitions for. The request will
 *                                 fail if the query is not root partitionable. For a query to be root
 *                                 partitionable, it needs to satisfy a few conditions. For example, the first
 *                                 operator in the query execution plan must be a distributed union operator.
 *                                 For more information about other conditions, see [Read data in
 *                                 parallel](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads#read_data_in_parallel).
 *
 *                                 The query request must not contain DML commands, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or
 *                                 DELETE. Use
 *                                 [ExecuteStreamingSql][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.ExecuteStreamingSql] with a
 *                                 PartitionedDml transaction for large, partition-friendly DML operations.
