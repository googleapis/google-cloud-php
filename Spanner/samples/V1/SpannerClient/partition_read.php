/**
 * Creates a set of partition tokens that can be used to execute a read
 * operation in parallel.  Each of the returned partition tokens can be used
 * by [StreamingRead][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.StreamingRead] to specify a
 * subset of the read result to read.  The same session and read-only
 * transaction must be used by the PartitionReadRequest used to create the
 * partition tokens and the ReadRequests that use the partition tokens.  There
 * are no ordering guarantees on rows returned among the returned partition
 * tokens, or even within each individual StreamingRead call issued with a
 * partition_token.
 *
 * Partition tokens become invalid when the session used to create them
 * is deleted, is idle for too long, begins a new transaction, or becomes too
 * old.  When any of these happen, it is not possible to resume the read, and
 * the whole operation must be restarted from the beginning.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSession The session used to create the partitions. Please see
 *                                 {@see SpannerClient::sessionName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $table            The name of the table in the database to be read.
