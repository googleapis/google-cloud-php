/**
 * Commits a transaction. The request includes the mutations to be
 * applied to rows in the database.
 *
 * `Commit` might return an `ABORTED` error. This can occur at any time;
 * commonly, the cause is conflicts with concurrent
 * transactions. However, it can also happen for a variety of other
 * reasons. If `Commit` returns `ABORTED`, the caller should re-attempt
 * the transaction from the beginning, re-using the same session.
 *
 * On very rare occasions, `Commit` might return `UNKNOWN`. This can happen,
 * for example, if the client job experiences a 1+ hour networking failure.
 * At that point, Cloud Spanner has lost track of the transaction outcome and
 * we recommend that you perform another read from the database to see the
 * state of things as they are now.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSession The session in which the transaction to be committed is running. Please see
 *                                 {@see SpannerClient::sessionName()} for help formatting this field.
