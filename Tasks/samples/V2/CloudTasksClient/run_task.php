/**
 * Forces a task to run now.
 *
 * When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if
 * the task is already running, the queue has reached its
 * [RateLimits][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RateLimits] or is
 * [PAUSED][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.State.PAUSED].
 *
 * This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For
 * example, [RunTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2.CloudTasks.RunTask] can be used to
 * retry a failed task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task
 * to be dispatched now.
 *
 * The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned
 * contains the [status][Task.status] after the task is dispatched but
 * before the task is received by its target.
 *
 * If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's
 * target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task's
 * [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Task.schedule_time] will be reset to
 * the time that [RunTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2.CloudTasks.RunTask] was
 * called plus the retry delay specified in the queue's
 * [RetryConfig][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig].
 *
 * [RunTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2.CloudTasks.RunTask] returns
 * [NOT_FOUND][google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND] when it is called on a
 * task that has already succeeded or permanently failed.
 *
 * @param string $formattedName The task name. For example:
 *                              `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`
 *                              Please see {@see CloudTasksClient::taskName()} for help formatting this field.
