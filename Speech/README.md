support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to
that project.

### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-speech
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
use Google\Cloud\Speech\V1\RecognitionConfig\AudioEncoding;
use Google\Cloud\Speech\V1\RecognitionConfig;
use Google\Cloud\Speech\V1\StreamingRecognitionConfig;

$recognitionConfig = new RecognitionConfig();
$recognitionConfig->setEncoding(AudioEncoding::FLAC);
$recognitionConfig->setSampleRateHertz(44100);
$recognitionConfig->setLanguageCode('en-US');
$config = new StreamingRecognitionConfig();
$config->setConfig($recognitionConfig);

$audioResource = fopen('path/to/audio.flac', 'r');

$responses = $speechClient->recognizeAudioStream($config, $audioResource);

foreach ($responses as $element) {
    // doSomethingWith($element);
}
```

### Version

This component is considered GA (generally available). As such, it will not introduce backwards-incompatible changes in
any minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests with the highest priority.

### Next Steps

1. Understand the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/).
2. Take a look at [in-depth usage samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docs-samples/tree/master/speech/).
