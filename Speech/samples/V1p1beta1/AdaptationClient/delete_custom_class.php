 * Delete a custom class.

 *
 *                              `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/customClasses/{custom_class}`
 *
 *                              Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America),
 *                              and `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com`
 *                              endpoint, use the `global` location. To specify a region, use a
 *                              [regional endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints)
 *                              with matching `us` or `eu` location value. Please see
 *                              {@see AdaptationClient::customClassName()} for help formatting this field.
