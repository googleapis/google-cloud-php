Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

any minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests with the highest priority.
