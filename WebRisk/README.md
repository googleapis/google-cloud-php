support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to

### Installation

Install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-web-risk
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
use Google\Cloud\WebRisk\V1\ThreatType;
use Google\Cloud\WebRisk\V1\WebRiskServiceClient;

$webrisk = new WebRiskServiceClient();

$uri = 'http://testsafebrowsing.appspot.com/s/malware.html';
$response = $webrisk->searchUris($uri, [
    ThreatType::MALWARE,
    ThreatType::SOCIAL_ENGINEERING
]);

$threats = $response->getThreat();
if ($threats) {
    echo $uri . ' has the following threats:' . PHP_EOL;
    foreach ($threats->getThreatTypes() as $threat) {
        echo ThreatType::name($threat) . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
