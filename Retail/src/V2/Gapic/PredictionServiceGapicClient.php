     *
     *                                We currently support three placements with the following IDs by default:
     *
     *                                * `shopping_cart`: Predicts products frequently bought together with one or
     *                                more  products in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after
     *                                `add-to-cart` events, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart
     *                                page.
     *
     *                                * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely
     *                                engage with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the
     *                                specified `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you.
     *
     *                                * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely
     *                                engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or
     *                                viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its
     *                                relevance to a specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail
     *                                pages. For example - More products like this.
     *
     *                                * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 products recently viewed by
     *                                the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones first. Returns
     *                                nothing if neither of them has viewed any products yet. For example -
     *                                Recently viewed.
     *
     *                                The full list of available placements can be seen at
     *                                https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/catalogs/default_catalog/placements
     * @param UserEvent $userEvent    Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at and what action
     *                                they took to trigger the predict request. Note that this user event detail
     *                                won't be ingested to userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write
     *                                request is required for event logging.
     * @param array     $optionalArgs {
     *     Optional.
     *
     *     @type int $pageSize
     *           Maximum number of results to return per page. Set this property
     *           to the number of prediction results needed. If zero, the service will
     *           choose a reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is 100. Values
     *           above 100 will be coerced to 100.
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *           The previous PredictResponse.next_page_token.
     *     @type string $filter
     *           Filter for restricting prediction results with a length limit of 5,000
     *           characters. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag.
     *
     *           * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that match all of the
     *           specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the
     *           expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the
     *           tag values by a space. `-"tagA"` is also supported and is equivalent to
     *           `NOT "tagA"`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings
     *           with a size limit of 1,000 characters.
     *
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products that do not
     *           have a
     *           stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK.
     *
     *           Examples:
     *
     *           * tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional")
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems  tag=(-"promotional")
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems
     *
     *           If your filter blocks all prediction results, nothing will be returned. If
     *           you want generic (unfiltered) popular products to be returned instead, set
     *           `strictFiltering` to false in `PredictRequest.params`.
     *     @type bool $validateOnly
     *           Use validate only mode for this prediction query. If set to true, a
     *           dummy model will be used that returns arbitrary products.
     *           Note that the validate only mode should only be used for testing the API,
     *           or if the model is not ready.
     *     @type array $params
     *           Additional domain specific parameters for the predictions.
     *
     *           Allowed values:
     *
     *           * `returnProduct`: Boolean. If set to true, the associated product
     *           object will be returned in the `results.metadata` field in the
     *           prediction response.
     *           * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction 'score'
     *           corresponding to each returned product will be set in the
     *           `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. The given
     *           'score' indicates the probability of an product being clicked/purchased
     *           given the user's context and history.
     *           * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service
     *           will return generic (unfiltered) popular products instead of empty if
     *           your filter blocks all prediction results.
     *     @type array $labels
     *           The labels for the predict request.
     *
     *           * Label keys can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, must start
     *           with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit.
     *           * Non-zero label values can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens,
     *           must start with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit.
     *           * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given request.
     *
     *           See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
     *     @type RetrySettings|array $retrySettings
     *           Retry settings to use for this call. Can be a
     *           {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} object, or an associative array of retry
     *           settings parameters. See the documentation on
     *           {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} for example usage.
