     *           PHP array.
     *           *Advanced usage*: In addition, this option can also accept a pre-constructed

     *           `rest` or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already

     *                                request is required for event logging.

     *                                fixed ID for different users. If you are trying to receive non-personalized

     *                                performance), instead set
     *                                [UserEvent.visitor_id][google.cloud.retail.v2.UserEvent.visitor_id] to a

     * @param array     $optionalArgs {
     *     Optional.
     *
     *     @type int $pageSize
     *           Maximum number of results to return. Set this property to the number of
     *           prediction results needed. If zero, the service will choose a reasonable
     *           default. The maximum allowed value is 100. Values above 100 will be coerced
     *           to 100.
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *           This field is not used; leave it unset.
     *     @type string $filter
     *           Filter for restricting prediction results with a length limit of 5,000
     *           characters. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag.
     *
     *           * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that match all of the
     *           specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the
     *           expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the
     *           tag values by a space. `-"tagA"` is also supported and is equivalent to
     *           `NOT "tagA"`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings
     *           with a size limit of 1,000 characters.
     *
     *           Note: "Recently viewed" models don't support tag filtering at the
     *           moment.
     *
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products that do not
     *           have a
     *           stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK.
     *
     *           Examples:
     *
     *           * tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional")
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems  tag=(-"promotional")
     *           * filterOutOfStockItems
     *
     *           If your filter blocks all prediction results, the API will return generic
     *           (unfiltered) popular products. If you only want results strictly matching
     *           the filters, set `strictFiltering` to True in `PredictRequest.params` to
     *           receive empty results instead.
     *           Note that the API will never return items with storageStatus of "EXPIRED"
     *           or "DELETED" regardless of filter choices.
     *
     *           If `filterSyntaxV2` is set to true under the `params` field, then
     *           attribute-based expressions are expected instead of the above described
     *           tag-based syntax. Examples:
     *
     *           * (colors: ANY("Red", "Blue")) AND NOT (categories: ANY("Phones"))
     *           * (availability: ANY("IN_STOCK")) AND
     *           (colors: ANY("Red") OR categories: ANY("Phones"))
     *     @type bool $validateOnly
     *           Use validate only mode for this prediction query. If set to true, a
     *           dummy model will be used that returns arbitrary products.
     *           Note that the validate only mode should only be used for testing the API,
     *           or if the model is not ready.
     *     @type array $params
     *           Additional domain specific parameters for the predictions.
     *
     *           Allowed values:
     *
     *           * `returnProduct`: Boolean. If set to true, the associated product
     *           object will be returned in the `results.metadata` field in the
     *           prediction response.
     *           * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction 'score'
     *           corresponding to each returned product will be set in the
     *           `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. The given
     *           'score' indicates the probability of an product being clicked/purchased
     *           given the user's context and history.
     *           * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service
     *           will return generic (unfiltered) popular products instead of empty if
     *           your filter blocks all prediction results.
     *           * `priceRerankLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then
     *           it needs to be one of {'no-price-reranking', 'low-price-reranking',
     *           'medium-price-reranking', 'high-price-reranking'}. This gives
     *           request-level control and adjusts prediction results based on product
     *           price.
     *           * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then
     *           it needs to be one of {'no-diversity', 'low-diversity',
     *           'medium-diversity', 'high-diversity', 'auto-diversity'}. This gives
     *           request-level control and adjusts prediction results based on product
     *           category.
     *           * `filterSyntaxV2`: Boolean. False by default. If set to true, the `filter`
     *           field is interpreteted according to the new, attribute-based syntax.
     *     @type array $labels
     *           The labels applied to a resource must meet the following requirements:
     *
     *           * Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum of 64.
     *           * Each label must be a key-value pair.
     *           * Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63
     *           characters and cannot be empty. Values can be empty and have a maximum
     *           length of 63 characters.
     *           * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters,
     *           underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and
     *           international characters are allowed.
     *           * The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you can use the same
     *           key with multiple resources.
     *           * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character.
     *
