/**
 * Represents a Transaction
 *
 * A transaction is a set of Datastore operations on one or more entities. Each
 * transaction is guaranteed to be atomic, which means that transactions are
 * never partially applied. Either all of the operations in the transaction are
 * applied, or none of them are applied.
 *
 * It is highly recommended that users read and understand the underlying
 * concepts in [Transactions](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/transactions)
 * before beginning.
 *
 * Mutations (i.e. insert, update and delete) are not executed immediately.
 * Calls to those methods (and their batch equivalents) will enqueue a new
 * mutation. Calling {@see \Google\Cloud\Datastore\Transaction::commit()} will
 * execute all the mutations in the order they were enqueued, and end the
 * transaction.
 *
 * Lookups and queries can be run in a transaction, so long as they are run
 * prior to committing or rolling back the transaction.
 *
 * Transactions are an **optional** feature of Google Cloud Datastore. Queries,
 * lookups and mutations can be executed outside of a Transaction from
 * {@see \Google\Cloud\Datastore\DatastoreClient}.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * use Google\Cloud\Datastore\DatastoreClient;
 *
 * $datastore = new DatastoreClient();
 *
 * $transaction = $datastore->transaction();
 * ```
 *
 * @see https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/transactions Transactions
