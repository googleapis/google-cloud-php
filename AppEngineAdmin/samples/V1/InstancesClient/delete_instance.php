 * Stops a running instance.

 * [flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-instances-are-managed)).
 *
 * To ensure that instances are not re-created and avoid getting billed, you
 * can stop all instances within the target version by changing the serving
 * status of the version to `STOPPED` with the
 * [`apps.services.versions.patch`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/reference/rest/v1/apps.services.versions/patch)
 * method.

 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code

 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
