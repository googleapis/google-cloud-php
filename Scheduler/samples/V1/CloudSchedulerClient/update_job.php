/**
 * Updates a job.
 *
 * If successful, the updated [Job][google.cloud.scheduler.v1.Job] is returned. If the job does
 * not exist, `NOT_FOUND` is returned.
 *
 * If UpdateJob does not successfully return, it is possible for the
 * job to be in an [Job.State.UPDATE_FAILED][google.cloud.scheduler.v1.Job.State.UPDATE_FAILED] state. A job in this state may
 * not be executed. If this happens, retry the UpdateJob request
 * until a successful response is received.

 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code

 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
