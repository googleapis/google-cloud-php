$ composer require google/cloud
```

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\Compute\V1\InstancesClient;

$instances = new InstancesClient();
foreach ($instances->list_('[MY_PROJECT_ID]', 'us-west1') as $instance) {
    print($instance->getName() . PHP_EOL);
}
```

### Version

any minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests with the highest priority.
