 * Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `items.quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request.
