/**
 * Returns the specified Region resource. Gets a list of available regions by making a list() request. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request.
 *
 * @param string $project Project ID for this request.
 * @param string $region  Name of the region resource to return.
