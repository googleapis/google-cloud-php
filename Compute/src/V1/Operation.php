 * You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses.
 * Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
 * - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource.
 * - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource.
 * - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource.
 * For more information, read  Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. (== resource_for {$api_version}.globalOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.regionOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.zoneOperations ==)
