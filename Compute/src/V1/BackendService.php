If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
     *     @type string $name
     *           Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
     *     @type string $network
     *           The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs. This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\Compute\V1\OutlierDetection $outlier_detection
     *           Settings controlling the eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool for the backend service. If not set, this feature is considered disabled. This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, or GRPC, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. 
     *     @type int $port
     *           Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing, omit port.
     *     @type string $port_name
     *           A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for communication to the backend VMs in that group. The named port must be [defined on each backend instance group](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#named_ports). This parameter has no meaning if the backends are NEGs. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing, omit port_name.
     *     @type string $protocol
     *           The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or GRPC. depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic Director configuration. Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic Director for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
     *           Check the Protocol enum for the list of possible values.
     *     @type string $region
     *           [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
     *     @type string $security_policy
     *           [Output Only] The resource URL for the security policy associated with this backend service.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\Compute\V1\SecuritySettings $security_settings
     *           This field specifies the security settings that apply to this backend service. This field is applicable to a global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
     *     @type string $self_link
     *           [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
     *     @type array<string>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $service_bindings
     *           URLs of networkservices.ServiceBinding resources. Can only be set if load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If set, lists of backends and health checks must be both empty.
     *     @type string $session_affinity
     *           Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Only NONE and HEADER_FIELD are supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true. For more details, see: [Session Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#session_affinity).
     *           Check the SessionAffinity enum for the list of possible values.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\Compute\V1\Subsetting $subsetting
     *     @type int $timeout_sec
     *           The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending on the type of load balancer. For more information see, Backend service settings. The default is 30 seconds. The full range of timeout values allowed goes from 1 through 2,147,483,647 seconds. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true. Instead, use maxStreamDuration.
