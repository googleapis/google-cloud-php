For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided.
     *     @type string $network_tier
     *           This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address.
     *           Check the NetworkTier enum for the list of possible values.
     *     @type bool $no_automate_dns_zone
     *           This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
     *     @type string $port_range
     *           This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. - By backend service-based network load balancers, target pool-based network load balancers, internal proxy load balancers, external proxy load balancers, Traffic Director, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See port specifications for details. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have overlapping portRanges. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have overlapping portRanges. &#64;pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
     *     @type array<string>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $ports
     *           This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. - By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based network load balancers, and internal protocol forwarding. You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous. Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot share any values defined in ports. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot share any values defined in ports. The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive. &#64;pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
     *     @type int|string $psc_connection_id
     *           [Output Only] The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding Rule.
     *     @type string $psc_connection_status
     *           
     *           Check the PscConnectionStatus enum for the list of possible values.
     *     @type string $region
     *           [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
     *     @type string $self_link
     *           [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
     *     @type array<\Google\Cloud\Compute\V1\ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistration>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $service_directory_registrations
     *           Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with. Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
     *     @type string $service_label
     *           An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified service name. The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for internal load balancing.
     *     @type string $service_name
     *           [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule. This field is only used for internal load balancing.
     *     @type array<string>|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $source_ip_ranges
     *           If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each source_ip_range entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
     *     @type string $subnetwork
     *           This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
     *     @type string $target
     *           The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - vpc-sc - APIs that support VPC Service Controls. - all-apis - All supported Google APIs. - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.
