     *     @type string $port_range
     *           This field can be used only if: * Load balancing scheme is one of EXTERNAL,  INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or INTERNAL_MANAGED, and * IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP.
     *           Packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target or  backend_service. You can only use one of ports, port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.
     *           Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:
     *           - TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
     *           - TargetHttpsProxy: 443
     *           - TargetGrpcProxy: no constraints

     *           - TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222
     *           - TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
     *     @type string[]|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\RepeatedField $ports
     *           The ports field is only supported when the forwarding rule references a backend_service directly. Supported load balancing products are Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing. Only packets addressed to the specified list of ports are forwarded to backends.
     *           You can only use one of ports and port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive.
     *           You can specify a list of up to five ports, which can be non-contiguous.
     *           For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, if you specify allPorts, you should not specify ports.
     *           For more information, see [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).

     *     @type string $region
     *           [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
     *     @type string $self_link
     *           [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

     *           It is only supported for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
     *     @type string $service_label
     *           An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified service name.
     *           The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
     *           This field is only used for internal load balancing.
     *     @type string $service_name
