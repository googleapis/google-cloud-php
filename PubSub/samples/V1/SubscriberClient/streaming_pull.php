/**
 * Establishes a stream with the server, which sends messages down to the
 * client. The client streams acknowledgements and ack deadline modifications
 * back to the server. The server will close the stream and return the status
 * on any error. The server may close the stream with status `UNAVAILABLE` to
 * reassign server-side resources, in which case, the client should
 * re-establish the stream. Flow control can be achieved by configuring the
 * underlying RPC channel.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSubscription    The subscription for which to initialize the new stream. This
 *                                         must be provided in the first request on the stream, and must not be set in
 *                                         subsequent requests from client to server.
 *                                         Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. Please see
 *                                         {@see SubscriberClient::subscriptionName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param int    $streamAckDeadlineSeconds The ack deadline to use for the stream. This must be provided in
 *                                         the first request on the stream, but it can also be updated on subsequent
 *                                         requests from client to server. The minimum deadline you can specify is 10
 *                                         seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
