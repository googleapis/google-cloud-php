/**
 * Creates a snapshot from the requested subscription. Snapshots are used in
 * [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations,
 * which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can
 * set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the
 * state captured by a snapshot.
 * If the snapshot already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
 * If the requested subscription doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.
 * If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot
 * would expire in less than 1 hour -- then `FAILED_PRECONDITION` is returned.
 * See also the `Snapshot.expire_time` field. If the name is not provided in
 * the request, the server will assign a random
 * name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming
 * to the [resource name format]
 * (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub-basics#resource_names). The
 * generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for
 * REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
 *
 * @param string $formattedName         User-provided name for this snapshot. If the name is not provided
 *                                      in the request, the server will assign a random name for this snapshot on
 *                                      the same project as the subscription. Note that for REST API requests, you
 *                                      must specify a name.  See the [resource name
 *                                      rules](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub-basics#resource_names).
 *                                      Format is `projects/{project}/snapshots/{snap}`. Please see
 *                                      {@see SubscriberClient::snapshotName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $formattedSubscription The subscription whose backlog the snapshot retains.
 *                                      Specifically, the created snapshot is guaranteed to retain:
 *                                      (a) The existing backlog on the subscription. More precisely, this is
 *                                      defined as the messages in the subscription's backlog that are
 *                                      unacknowledged upon the successful completion of the
 *                                      `CreateSnapshot` request; as well as:
 *                                      (b) Any messages published to the subscription's topic following the
 *                                      successful completion of the CreateSnapshot request.
 *                                      Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. Please see
 *                                      {@see SubscriberClient::subscriptionName()} for help formatting this field.
