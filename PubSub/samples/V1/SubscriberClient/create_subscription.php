/**
 * Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the [resource name rules]
 * (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub-basics#resource_names).
 * If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
 * If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.
 *
 * If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random
 * name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming
 * to the [resource name format]
 * (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub-basics#resource_names). The
 * generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that
 * for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
 *
 * @param string $name           The name of the subscription. It must have the format
 *                               `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must
 *                               start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers
 *                               (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),
 *                               plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters
 *                               in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`.
 * @param string $formattedTopic The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving
 *                               messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this
 *                               field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted. Please see
 *                               {@see SubscriberClient::topicName()} for help formatting this field.
