/**
 * Modifies the ack deadline for a specific message. This method is useful
 * to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the
 * subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the
 * processing was interrupted. Note that this does not modify the
 * subscription-level `ackDeadlineSeconds` used for subsequent messages.
 *
 * @param string $formattedSubscription The name of the subscription.
 *                                      Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. Please see
 *                                      {@see SubscriberClient::subscriptionName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $ackIdsElement         List of acknowledgment IDs.
 * @param int    $ackDeadlineSeconds    The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was
 *                                      sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack
 *                                      deadline will expire 10 seconds after the `ModifyAckDeadline` call was
 *                                      made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for
 *                                      delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an
 *                                      increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates).
 *                                      The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds.
 *                                      The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
