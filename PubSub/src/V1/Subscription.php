     *           Optional. A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's

     *           subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is
     *           issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set,
     *           a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed
     *           value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set,
     *           but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.
     *     @type string $filter
     *           Optional. An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter
     *           language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty,
     *           then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are
     *           delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered
     *           out.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\PubSub\V1\DeadLetterPolicy $dead_letter_policy
     *           Optional. A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
     *           messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead
     *           lettering is disabled.
     *           The Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's

     *     @type \Google\Cloud\PubSub\V1\RetryPolicy $retry_policy
     *           Optional. A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for
     *           this subscription.
     *           If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies
     *           that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
     *           RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgment deadline exceeded
     *           events for a given message.
     *     @type bool $detached
     *           Optional. Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic.
     *           Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't
     *           retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return
     *           FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to
     *           the endpoint will not be made.
     *     @type bool $enable_exactly_once_delivery
     *           Optional. If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the
     *           delivery of a message with a given value of `message_id` on this
     *           subscription:
     *           * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent
     *           before the message's acknowledgment deadline expires.
     *           * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.
     *           Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message
     *           when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published
     *           multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are  considered distinct
     *           by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Duration $topic_message_retention_duration
     *           Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained
     *           after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set,
     *           messages published to the subscription's topic in the last
     *           `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See
     *           the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only
     *           in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
     *     @type int $state
     *           Output only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the
     *           subscription can receive messages.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\PubSub\V1\Subscription\AnalyticsHubSubscriptionInfo $analytics_hub_subscription_info
     *           Output only. Information about the associated Analytics Hub subscription.
     *           Only set if the subscritpion is created by Analytics Hub.
