/**
 * gRPC Transcoding
 * gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
 * more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
 * that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
 * APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
 * [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
 * Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
 * and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
 * and use it for large scale production services.
 * `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
 * how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
 * path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
 * gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
 * typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
 * Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
 * template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
 * as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
 * The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
 * the URL path.
 * Example:
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *             get: "/v1/{name=messages/&#42;}"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
 *     }
 *     message Message {
 *       string text = 1; // The resource content.
 *     }
 * This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
 * - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
 * - gRPC: `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
 * Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
 * automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
 * For example:
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *             get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       message SubMessage {
 *         string subfield = 1;
 *       }
 *       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
 *       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
 *       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
 *     }
 * This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
 * - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo`
 * - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub:
 * SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`
 * Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
 * primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
 * In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
 * as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
 * message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
 * `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
 * For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
 * specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
 * message resource collection:
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           body: "message"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message UpdateMessageRequest {
 *       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
 *       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
 *     }
 * The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
 * representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
 * protos JSON encoding:
 * - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
 * - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
 * The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
 * every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
 * request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
 * the update method:
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           body: "*"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message Message {
 *       string message_id = 1;
 *       string text = 2;
 *     }
 * The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
 * - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
 * - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`
 * Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
 * have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
 * the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
 * defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
 * which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
 * It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
 * the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           additional_bindings {
 *             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
 *           }
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       string message_id = 1;
 *       string user_id = 2;
 *     }
 * This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
 * - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
 * - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
 * - HTTP: `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456`
 * - gRPC: `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`
 * Rules for HTTP mapping
 * 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
 *    message) are classified into three categories:
 *    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
 *    - Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They
 *    are passed via the HTTP
 *      request body.
 *    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
 *      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
 *      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
 *      name.
 *  2. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is "*", there is no URL
 *  query parameter, all fields
 *     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
 *  3. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP
 *  request body, all
 *     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
 * Path template syntax
 *     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
 *     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
 *     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
 *     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
 *     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
 *     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
 * The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
 * zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
 * except the `Verb`.
 * The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
 * template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
 * matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
 * is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
 * The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
 * contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
 * before the matching.
 * If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
 * `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
 * side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
 * server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
 * [Discovery
 * Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
 * `{var}`.
 * If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/&#42;}"`
 * or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
 * client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
 * The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
 * unchanged. Such variables show up in the
 * [Discovery
 * Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
 * `{+var}`.
 * Using gRPC API Service Configuration
 * gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
 * for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
 * service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
 * proto message.
 * As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
 * transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
 * `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
 * effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
 * have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
 * specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
 * configuration in the proto.
 * The following example selects a gRPC method and applies an `HttpRule` to it:
 *     http:
 *       rules:
 *         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
 *           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
 * Special notes
 * When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
 * proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
 * specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
 * While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
 * [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
 * Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
 * 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
 * does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
 * to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
 * for multi segment variables.
 * The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
 * because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
 * The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
 * is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
 * character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
 * Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
 * no client library can support such complicated mapping.
 * If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
 * the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
 * Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.
