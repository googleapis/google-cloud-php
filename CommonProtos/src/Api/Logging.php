/**
 * Logging configuration of the service.
 * The following example shows how to configure logs to be sent to the
 * producer and consumer projects. In the example, the `activity_history`
 * log is sent to both the producer and consumer projects, whereas the
 * `purchase_history` log is only sent to the producer project.
 *     monitored_resources:
 *     - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /city
 *         description: The city where the library branch is located in.
 *       - key: /name
 *         description: The name of the branch.
 *     logs:
 *     - name: activity_history
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /customer_id
 *     - name: purchase_history
 *     logging:
 *       producer_destinations:
 *       - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *         logs:
 *         - activity_history
 *         - purchase_history
 *       consumer_destinations:
 *       - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *         logs:
 *         - activity_history
