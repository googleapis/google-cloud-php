     *              are restricted or boosted based on the location provided.
     *              For example, `user_country_code: "au"`

     *              For example, `search_type: 1`
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\DiscoveryEngine\V1\SearchRequest\QueryExpansionSpec $query_expansion_spec

     *           implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify
     *           a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if
     *           the visitor logs in or out of the website.
     *           This field should NOT have a fixed value such as `unknown_visitor`.
     *           This should be the same identifier as

     *     @type array|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\MapField $user_labels
     *           The user labels applied to a resource must meet the following requirements:
     *           * Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum of 64.
     *           * Each label must be a key-value pair.
     *           * Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63
     *             characters and cannot be empty. Values can be empty and have a maximum
     *             length of 63 characters.
     *           * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters,
     *             underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and
     *             international characters are allowed.
     *           * The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you can use the same
     *             key with multiple resources.
     *           * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character.
     *           See [Google Cloud
     *           Document](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements)
     *           for more details.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\DiscoveryEngine\V1\SearchRequest\SearchAsYouTypeSpec $search_as_you_type_spec
     *           Search as you type configuration. Only supported for the
     *           [IndustryVertical.MEDIA][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.IndustryVertical.MEDIA]
     *           vertical.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\DiscoveryEngine\V1\SearchRequest\DisplaySpec $display_spec
     *           Optional. Config for display feature, like match highlighting on search
     *           results.
     *     @type string $session
     *           The session resource name. Optional.
     *           Session allows users to do multi-turn /search API calls or coordination
     *           between /search API calls and /answer API calls.
     *           Example #1 (multi-turn /search API calls):
     *             1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below).
     *             2. Call /search API with the session ID generated in the first call.
     *                Here, the previous search query gets considered in query
     *                standing. I.e., if the first query is "How did Alphabet do in 2022?"
     *                and the current query is "How about 2023?", the current query will
     *                be interpreted as "How did Alphabet do in 2023?".
     *           Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls):
     *             1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below).
     *             2. Call /answer API with the session ID generated in the first call.
     *                Here, the answer generation happens in the context of the search
     *                results from the first search call.
     *           Auto-session mode: when `projects/.../sessions/-` is used, a new session
     *           gets automatically created. Otherwise, users can use the create-session API
     *           to create a session manually.
     *           Multi-turn Search feature is currently at private GA stage. Please use
     *           v1alpha or v1beta version instead before we launch this feature to public
     *           GA. Or ask for allowlisting through Google Support team.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\DiscoveryEngine\V1\SearchRequest\SessionSpec $session_spec
     *           Session specification.
     *           Can be used only when `session` is set.
     *     @type int $relevance_threshold
     *           The relevance threshold of the search results.
     *           Default to Google defined threshold, leveraging a balance of
     *           precision and recall to deliver both highly accurate results and
     *           comprehensive coverage of relevant information.
     *           This feature is not supported for healthcare search.
     *     @type \Google\Cloud\DiscoveryEngine\V1\SearchRequest\RelevanceScoreSpec $relevance_score_spec
     *           Optional. The specification for returning the relevance score.
