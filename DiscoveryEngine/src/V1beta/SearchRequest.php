     *             `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field
     *             used with query embedding vector.
     *             `dotProduct`: embedding function between embedding_field_path and query
     *             embedding vector.
     *            Example ranking expression:
     *              If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the ranking expression
     *              could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 * dotProduct(doc_embedding)`.

     *     @type array|\Google\Protobuf\Internal\MapField $user_labels
     *           The user labels applied to a resource must meet the following requirements:
     *           * Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum of 64.
     *           * Each label must be a key-value pair.
     *           * Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63
     *             characters and cannot be empty. Values can be empty and have a maximum
     *             length of 63 characters.
     *           * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters,
     *             underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and
     *             international characters are allowed.
     *           * The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you can use the same
     *             key with multiple resources.
     *           * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character.
