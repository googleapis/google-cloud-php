### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh

```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Google\Cloud\BigQuery\BigQueryClient;

$bigQuery = new BigQueryClient();

// Get an instance of a previously created table.
$dataset = $bigQuery->dataset('my_dataset');
$table = $dataset->table('my_table');

// Begin a job to import data from a CSV file into the table.
$loadJobConfig = $table->load(
    fopen('/data/my_data.csv', 'r')
);
$job = $table->runJob($loadJobConfig);

// Run a query and inspect the results.
$queryJobConfig = $bigQuery->query(
    'SELECT * FROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_table`'
);
$queryResults = $bigQuery->runQuery($queryJobConfig);

foreach ($queryResults as $row) {
    print_r($row);
}
```
