/**
 * Writes updated `DeliveryVehicle` data to Fleet Engine, and assigns
 * `Tasks` to the `DeliveryVehicle`. You cannot update the name of the
 * `DeliveryVehicle`. You *can* update `remaining_vehicle_journey_segments`
 * though, but it must contain all of the `VehicleJourneySegment`s currently
 * on the `DeliveryVehicle`. The `task_id`s are retrieved from
 * `remaining_vehicle_journey_segments`, and their corresponding `Tasks` are
 * assigned to the `DeliveryVehicle` if they have not yet been assigned.
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
