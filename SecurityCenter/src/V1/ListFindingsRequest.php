     * * `=` for all value types.
     * * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
     * * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
     * The supported value types are:
     * * string literals in quotes.
     * * integer literals without quotes.
     * * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
     * The following field and operator combinations are supported:
     * * name: `=`
     * * parent: `=`, `:`
     * * resource_name: `=`, `:`
     * * state: `=`, `:`
     * * category: `=`, `:`
     * * external_uri: `=`, `:`
     * * event_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
     *   Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.
     *   Examples:
     *     `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
     *     `event_time = 1560208038000`
     * * severity: `=`, `:`
     * * workflow_state: `=`, `:`
     * * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:`
     * * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
     *   For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
     *   Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
     *   existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""`
     *   Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a
     *   property not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""`
     * * resource:
     *   * resource.name: `=`, `:`
     *   * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:`
     *   * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:`
