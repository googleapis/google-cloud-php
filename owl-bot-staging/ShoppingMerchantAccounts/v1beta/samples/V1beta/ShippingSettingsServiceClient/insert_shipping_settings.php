 *
 *                                    1. Set etag field as empty string for initial shipping setting creation.
 *
 *                                    2. After initial creation, call get method to obtain an etag and current
 *                                    shipping setting data before call insert.
 *
 *                                    3. Modify to wanted shipping setting information.
 *
 *                                    4. Call insert method with the wanted shipping setting information with
 *                                    the etag obtained from step 2.
 *
 *                                    5. If shipping setting data changed between step 2 and step 4. Insert
 *                                    request will fail because the etag changes every time the shipping setting
 *                                    data changes. User should repeate step 2-4 with the new etag.
