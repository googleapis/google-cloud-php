/**
 * Moves an instance to the target instance configuration. You can use the
 * returned long-running operation to track
 * the progress of moving the instance.
 *
 * `MoveInstance` returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the instance meets any of
 * the following criteria:
 *
 * * Is undergoing a move to a different instance configuration
 * * Has backups
 * * Has an ongoing update
 * * Contains any CMEK-enabled databases
 * * Is a free trial instance
 *
 * While the operation is pending:
 *
 * * All other attempts to modify the instance, including changes to its
 * compute capacity, are rejected.
 * * The following database and backup admin operations are rejected:
 *
 * * `DatabaseAdmin.CreateDatabase`
 * * `DatabaseAdmin.UpdateDatabaseDdl` (disabled if default_leader is
 * specified in the request.)
 * * `DatabaseAdmin.RestoreDatabase`
 * * `DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup`
 * * `DatabaseAdmin.CopyBackup`
 *
 * * Both the source and target instance configurations are subject to
 * hourly compute and storage charges.
 * * The instance might experience higher read-write latencies and a higher
 * transaction abort rate. However, moving an instance doesn't cause any
 * downtime.
 *
 * The returned long-running operation has
 * a name of the format
 * `<instance_name>/operations/<operation_id>` and can be used to track
 * the move instance operation. The
 * metadata field type is
 * [MoveInstanceMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.MoveInstanceMetadata].
 * The response field type is
 * [Instance][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.Instance],
 * if successful.
 * Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
 * [cancel_time][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.MoveInstanceMetadata.cancel_time].
 * Cancellation is not immediate because it involves moving any data
 * previously moved to the target instance configuration back to the original
 * instance configuration. You can use this operation to track the progress of
 * the cancellation. Upon successful completion of the cancellation, the
 * operation terminates with `CANCELLED` status.
 *
 * If not cancelled, upon completion of the returned operation:
 *
 * * The instance successfully moves to the target instance
 * configuration.
 * * You are billed for compute and storage in target instance
 * configuration.
 *
 * Authorization requires the `spanner.instances.update` permission on
 * the resource [instance][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.Instance].
 *
 * For more details, see
 * [Move an instance](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/move-instance).
 *
 * @param string $formattedName         The instance to move.
 *                                      Values are of the form `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>`. Please see
 *                                      {@see InstanceAdminClient::instanceName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $formattedTargetConfig The target instance configuration where to move the instance.
