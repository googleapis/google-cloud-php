/**
 * Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified project.
 *
 * CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used
 * to append additional IAM settings.
 *
 * Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can
 * render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how
 * the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles.
 *
 * The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:
 *
 * + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
 * `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.
 *
 * + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group
 * that is part of an organization. For example,
 * group&#64;myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in
 * the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com
 * organization.
 *
 * + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
 * without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
 * invited using the Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.
 *
 * + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
 * must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
 * explicitly accept the invitation.
 *
 * + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
 * `setIamPolicy()`;
 * they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.
 *
 * + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
 * accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.
 *
 * + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least
 * one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the
 * policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner
 * from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy
 * projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to
 * IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is
 * rectified.
 *
 * + Calling this method requires enabling the App Engine Admin API.
 *
 * @param string $resource REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
 *                         See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field.
