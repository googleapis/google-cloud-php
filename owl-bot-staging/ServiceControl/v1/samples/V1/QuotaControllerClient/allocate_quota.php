/**
 * Attempts to allocate quota for the specified consumer. It should be called
 * before the operation is executed.
 *
 * This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.quota`
 * permission on the specified service. For more information, see
 * [Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
 *
 * **NOTE:** The client **must** fail-open on server errors `INTERNAL`,
 * `UNKNOWN`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. To ensure system
 * reliability, the server may inject these errors to prohibit any hard
 * dependency on the quota functionality.
 *
 * This sample has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
 * template only. It will require modifications to work:
 *  - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 *  - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client,
 *    please see the apiEndpoint client configuration option for more details.
