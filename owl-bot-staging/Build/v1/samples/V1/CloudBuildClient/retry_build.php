/**
 * Creates a new build based on the specified build.
 *
 * This method creates a new build using the original build request, which may
 * or may not result in an identical build.
 *
 * For triggered builds:
 *
 * * Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a retry of a
 * triggered build will result in a build that uses the same revision.
 *
 * For non-triggered builds that specify `RepoSource`:
 *
 * * If the original build built from the tip of a branch, the retried build
 * will build from the tip of that branch, which may not be the same revision
 * as the original build.
 * * If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID, the retried
 * build will use the identical source.
 *
 * For builds that specify `StorageSource`:
 *
 * * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage without
 * specifying the generation of the object, the new build will use the current
 * object, which may be different from the original build source.
 * * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and specified the
 * generation of the object, the new build will attempt to use the same
 * object, which may or may not be available depending on the bucket's
 * lifecycle management settings.
 *
 * @param string $projectId ID of the project.
 * @param string $id        Build ID of the original build.
