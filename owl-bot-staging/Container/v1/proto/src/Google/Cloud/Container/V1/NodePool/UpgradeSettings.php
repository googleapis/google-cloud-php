/**
 * These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of
 * disruption caused by an upgrade.
 * maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously
 * unavailable.
 * maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the
 * node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of
 * available nodes.
 * (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many
 * nodes are being upgraded at the same time).
 * Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to
 * be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0,
 * this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of
 * PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.)
 * Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2,
 * maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes
 * simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings
 * down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that
 * there are always at least 4 nodes available.
