/**
 * Lists events from a Google Chat space. For each event, the
 * [payload](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.oneof_payload)
 * contains the most recent version of the Chat resource. For example, if you
 * list events about new space members, the server returns `Membership`
 * resources that contain the latest membership details. If new members were
 * removed during the requested period, the event payload contains an empty
 * `Membership` resource.
 *
 * Requires [user
 * authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).
 * To list events, the authenticated user must be a member of the space.
 *
 * For an example, see [List events from a Google Chat
 * space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-space-events).
 *
 * @param string $formattedParent Resource name of the [Google Chat
 *                                space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces)
 *                                where the events occurred.
 *
 *                                Format: `spaces/{space}`. Please see
 *                                {@see ChatServiceClient::spaceName()} for help formatting this field.
 * @param string $filter          A query filter.
 *
 *                                You must specify at least one event type (`event_type`)
 *                                using the has `:` operator. To filter by multiple event types, use the `OR`
 *                                operator. Omit batch event types in your filter. The request automatically
 *                                returns any related batch events. For example, if you filter by new
 *                                reactions
 *                                (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.created`), the server also returns
 *                                batch new reactions events
 *                                (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.batchCreated`). For a list of supported
 *                                event types, see the [`SpaceEvents` reference
 *                                documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.event_type).
 *
 *                                Optionally, you can also filter by start time (`start_time`) and
 *                                end time (`end_time`):
 *
 *                                * `start_time`: Exclusive timestamp from which to start listing space
 *                                events.
 *                                You can list events that occurred up to 28 days ago. If unspecified, lists
 *                                space events from the past 28 days.
 *                                * `end_time`: Inclusive timestamp until which space events are listed.
 *                                If unspecified, lists events up to the time of the request.
 *
 *                                To specify a start or end time, use the equals `=` operator and format in
 *                                [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339). To filter by both
 *                                `start_time` and `end_time`, use the `AND` operator.
 *
 *                                For example, the following queries are valid:
 *
 *                                ```
 *                                start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND
 *                                end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00"
 *                                ```
 *                                ```
 *                                start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND
 *                                (event_types:"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated" OR
 *                                event_types:"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created")
 *                                ```
 *
 *                                The following queries are invalid:
 *
 *                                ```
 *                                start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" OR
 *                                end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00"
 *                                ```
 *                                ```

 *                                ```
 *
 *                                Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
 *                                error.
