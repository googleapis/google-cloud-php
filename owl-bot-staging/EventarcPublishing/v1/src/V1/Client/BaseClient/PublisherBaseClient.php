/**
 * Service Description: Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to
 * a subscriber.
 *
 * An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
 * product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
 *
 * A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
 *
 * A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
 *
 * A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
 *
 * Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
 * by the subscriber in their GCP project. A Channel represents a subscriber's
 * intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is associated with
 * exactly one event provider.
 *
 * ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
 * is created and managed by the partner in their GCP project. A
 * ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
 * subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
 * Channel.
 *
 * Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods.
 *
 * This class is currently experimental and may be subject to changes. See {@see
 * \Google\Cloud\Eventarc\Publishing\V1\PublisherClient} for the stable
 * implementation
 *
 * @experimental

 * @internal

     *           The address of the API remote host. May optionally include the port, formatted
     *           as "<uri>:<port>". Default 'eventarcpublishing.googleapis.com:443'.
     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials
     *           The credentials to be used by the client to authorize API calls. This option
     *           accepts either a path to a credentials file, or a decoded credentials file as a
     *           PHP array.
     *           *Advanced usage*: In addition, this option can also accept a pre-constructed
     *           {@see \Google\Auth\FetchAuthTokenInterface} object or

     *     @type string|array $clientConfig
     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either
     *           a path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data. By
     *           default this settings points to the default client config file, which is
     *           provided in the resources folder.
     *     @type string|TransportInterface $transport
     *           The transport used for executing network requests. May be either the string
     *           `rest` or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already
     *           instantiated {@see \Google\ApiCore\Transport\TransportInterface} object. Note
     *           that when this object is provided, any settings in $transportConfig, and any

     *           Configuration options that will be used to construct the transport. Options for
     *           each supported transport type should be passed in a key for that transport. For
     *           example:

     *           supported options.

     *           A callable which returns the client cert as a string. This can be used to
     *           provide a certificate and private key to the transport layer for mTLS.
